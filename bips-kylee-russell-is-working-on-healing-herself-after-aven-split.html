It’s just … it was horrible. I think that she’s doing her best and I know that she’s working on healing herself.”</p><p>Kylee, 26, announced in December 2023 that she and Aven, 30, had <a href=#>called it quits</a> after multiple alleged “infidelities.” Mercedes noted that it “sucked” for Kylee to find out from “random people” telling her.</p><p>While Mercedes noted that Aven “f–ked up because cheating is never OK,” she said she does “feel remorse for him almost.”</p><p>“It’s also sad for him too. Obviously he’s the one that screwed up but he was getting so much hate too,” she continued. “It’s just a crappy situation all around and I feel for both of them. Obviously [I] do not think what he did was OK at all.”</p><p>Mercedes, who noted she “would do anything” for Kylee, said her friend is “working on herself and doing better every day,” and has “grown a lot” from the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BiP-s-Mercedes-Northup-Says-Kylee-Russell-Is-Working-on-Healing-Herself-Post-Aven-Jones-Split-521-916.jpg><p>The news of Kylee and Aven’s split came one day after the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale aired, where the twosome left the beaches of Mexico hand in hand.</p><p>“Following our relationship announcement yesterday, I want to thank my God, he didn’t allow me to live another day in the dark,” Kylee wrote via her Instagram Story. “In the last 24 hours, I have been grasping with the fact that one of the most important relationships in my life dissolved due to multiple infidelities.”</p><p>Kylee added: “This is not just a show but my real life and for the foreseeable future, I will be in a time of healing and trying to put the puzzle pieces of my life back together. Please respect my privacy at this time. Love you all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the unexpected breakup, Aven took to his own Instagram Story one day later to <a href=#>issue a statement</a>.</p><p>“After careful thought and consideration into writing this, I want to first and foremost apologize to Kylee, my family and my friends for my actions,” Aven, 30, wrote in a Sunday, December 10, Instagram Story statement. “I have made major mistakes in the relationship and hurt someone who was very close to me.”</p><p>He continued: “At this time, I am in an extremely, extremely low place trying to work on myself. I am doing my best to find healing, find myself and be a better person. Please have grace and respect for Kylee and her family through this difficult time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmiqKNiuLq4xJ5kq62jqLKtuIyiqmavn6e4qrrGZqanZZiarq21zaBkoZ2iqLKtsoyana2domKut7HNZqqppJmpfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-pennys-defense-fund-passes-1-million.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Penny's defense fund passes $1M in Jordan Neely charge</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-jay-z-and-blue-ivy-take-bike-ride-on-hawaiian-vacation-w210878.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonce, Jay Z and Blue Ivy Take Bike Ride on Hawaiian Vacation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
