Salazar’s simple response:</p><p>“I’m not going to be in <i>Allegiant</i> at all.”</p><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>That’s got to come as a surprise to fans of the series, given that Lynn was a fan favorite character who seemingly had more to do in the franchise. Lynn’s survival on screen was&nbsp;a change from Roth’s book, in which the character went out in a blaze of glory, and many had considered her survival in&nbsp;Insurgent an indicator that the character would play a larger role in&nbsp;Allegiant. That’s seemingly not the case – instead, it appears that the studio just wanted fans to get excited at Lynn’s&nbsp;inclusion without ever planning to give her an actual story arc.</p><p data-characters=725 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>The book version of Lynn was close friends with other Dauntless recruits Marlene (Suki Waterhouse) and Uriah (Keiynan Lonsdale) as well as the older sister of Hector (Emjay Anthony). Though she was not friends with Tris (Shailene Woodley) at first, Lynn warmed up to her in Insurgent, and there was a pivotal scene in which Tris had to pick saving Hector or Marlene during one of Jeanine Matthews’ (Kate Winslet) simulation attacks on Dauntless. She chose Hector, earning Lynn’s gratitude even amid her heartbreak. After she was fatally shot in the stomach at the end of Roth’s&nbsp;Insurgent, Lynn tearfully revealed that she was in love with Marlene and regretted not telling her before Marlene’s death.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=false>Of course, any book-to-film adaptation is going to leave stuff out, but it’s particularly surprising to see Lynn sidelined as she has been, despite Marlene’s death remaining in the finished cut of&nbsp;Insurgent. It’s doing a big disservice to the fans not to do right by a beloved book character but still throw them haphazardly into the mix. As frustrating as it will be for fans, I’m willing to bet no one’s going to even comment on Lynn in <strong><i>Allegiant</i></strong>, entirely negating her part in the books.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqairkWLAorjAs5irq12hxq%2B6jKWcn6xdlrmtscaimKesXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./this-hydrating-eye-cream-may-reduce-dark-circles-after-just-3-days-of-use.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Hydrating Eye Cream May Reduce Dark Circles After Just 3 Days of Use</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nickolaus.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nickolaus Hines, Author At All That's Interesting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
