So, while some breeds may seem more affectionate or willing to please their pet parent than others, all dogs are capable of being loyal.<h2>Why are dogs so loyal?</h2>There is a scientific basis for this: domestic dogs are descended from wolves, which man once took in and tamed with shelter and food in return for them acting as guard dogs. This reciprocal relationship remains in your dog's genes and their loyalty is a by-product of it.<h2>Who is smarter cat or dog?</h2>However, various studies have concluded that, overall, cats are not smarter than dogs.
