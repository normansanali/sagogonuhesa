Russell Ballard, has died at age 95.</p><p>This news comes after President Ballard experienced a brief hospital stay, though he was able to return home before his passing on Sunday, Nov. 12.</p><p>Officials of the Church said President Ballard died at 11:15 p.m. surrounded by loved ones.</p><h2>MORE on President M. Russell Ballard:</h2><p>President Ballard became an Apostle on Oct. 6, 1985, and was later announced as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on Jan. 16, 2018.</p><p>One of 15 men who oversaw the evolution of the Church, President Ballard made an imprint on millions.</p><p>Born on Oct. 8, 1928 to parents Melvin G. and Geraldine Smith Ballard, President Ballard grew up in the Salt Lake City area.<br></p><p>The only boy in a family of four children, President Ballard spent a lot of time working in all departments of his father's establishment, Ballard Motor Company, as a child and teen. It was there that he developed his dedicated work ethic.</p><p>“I learned through my dad that when you start something, you finish it,” President Ballard once said. “Ultimately, it works out to your satisfaction that either you win, and it becomes profitable, or you learn that it’s not going to work, and you step away from it, but you never leave wondering if you’re willing to stay with it.”</p><p>President Ballard went on to study at the University of Utah, where he met his wife Barbara at the "Hello Dolly Dance."</p><p>“She was not only beautiful but had a sparkling personality," President Ballard said of Barbara. "I knew from the beginning that I wanted to marry her, but she didn’t share the same feelings. It was a little hard convincing her. I kid her that getting her to agree to marry me was the greatest sales job I ever did.”</p><p>Barbara passed away on Oct. 1, 2018, at 86-years-old following a lengthy battle with several health issues, including Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>A family man, President Ballard is survived by his seven children, 43 grandchildren, 105 great-grandchildren and one great-great grandchild.</p><p>President Ballard lived a life of selflessness, devotion and courage. He will be remembered as a sensational leader of the Church.</p><p>“I have strong convictions that those who are really anchored in their faith in the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the mission of the Prophet Joseph and in the revelations that have come to the Church through him, which confirm and declare that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that the gospel is upon the earth, will be able to handle whatever life passes to them," President Ballard stated.</p><p>President Ballard's name was mentioned in a recent lawsuit against OUR founder Tim Ballard (no relation). The suit alleged President Ballard shared information with OUR about the Church's wealthy tithing donors. The <a href=# title=https://kutv.com/news/local/latter-day-saint-church-denies-allegations-of-sharing-confidential-tithing-records-with-tim-ballard-our-operation-underground-railroad-doug-andersen-attorney-general-sean-reyes# class=themeColorForLinks>Church denied the allegation in a statement</a>, saying, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regards tithing records as sacred and keeps them confidential. Leaders ensure such information is not used for personal, political, or commercial purposes. President Ballard has never released tithing records to OUR or any other organization."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwvNGeqqKclaPBbrmMq6ysq5WhuW6uwKWjmqqUYrGqsdJmmK1lkZyyboWUZmhqZWFoenN8kWw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ron-mcanally.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ron McAnally</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-does-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-438239-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Does Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
