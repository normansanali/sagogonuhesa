On the face of it, they should all perform the same and differ only in the functionality they provide - however, this is not the case. The obvious pointers are power consumption, but also the ability for the manufacturer to optimize USB speed, audio quality (based on audio codec), POST time and latency. This can come down to the manufacturing process and prowess, so these are tested.</p><p>For this review&nbsp;we are running using Windows 10 64-bit with the 1909&nbsp;update as per our <a href=#>Ryzen Threadripper 3960X and 3970X CPU review</a>.</p><h3><strong>Power Consumption</strong></h3><p>Power consumption was tested on the system while in a single ASUS GTX 980 GPU configuration with a wall meter connected to the Thermaltake 1200W power supply. This power supply has ~75% efficiency > 50W, and 90%+ efficiency at 250W, suitable for both idle and multi-GPU loading. This method of power reading allows us to compare the power management of the UEFI and the board to supply components with power under load, and includes typical PSU losses due to efficiency. These are the real-world values that consumers may expect from a typical system (minus the monitor) using this motherboard.</p><p>While this method for power measurement may not be ideal, and you feel these numbers are not representative due to the high wattage power supply being used (we use the same PSU to remain consistent over a series of reviews, and the fact that some boards on our testbed get tested with three or four high powered GPUs), the important point to take away is the relationship between the numbers. These boards are all under the same conditions, and thus the differences between them should be easy to spot.</p><p><img alt="Power Long Idle (w/GTX 1080)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph14171/powerlongidle.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="Power OS Idle (w/GTX 1080)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph14171/powerosidle.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="Power Prime95 Blend (w/GTX 1080)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph14171/powerprime.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Out of all the boards we tested above, the ASRock EPYCD8-2T shows impeccable power efficiency in our long idle, idle, and full load power testing. Compared directly against the GIGABYTE MZ31-AR0, it operates around 13 W lighter at full load, while it's 6 W at long idle, and 4 W lighter in an idle state.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Non-UEFI POST Time</strong></h3><p>Different motherboards have different POST sequences before an operating system is initialized. A lot of this is dependent on the board itself, and POST boot time is determined by the controllers on board (and the sequence of how those extras are organized). As part of our testing, we look at the POST Boot Time using a stopwatch. This is the time from pressing the ON button on the computer to when Windows starts loading. (We discount Windows loading as it is highly variable given Windows specific features.)</p><p><img alt="Non-UEFI POST Time" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph14171/nonuefiposttime.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The professional level server and workstations model tend to take longer to POST into the operating system than consumer boards, and our results show this. Typically a professional model with BMC takes longer due to controller initialization, but ASRock is a good 21&nbsp;seconds quicker than the GIGABYTE model at booting into Windows 10.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>DPC Latency</strong></h3><p>Deferred Procedure Call latency is a way in which Windows handles interrupt servicing. In order to wait for a processor to acknowledge the request, the system will queue all interrupt requests by priority. Critical interrupts will be handled as soon as possible, whereas lesser priority requests such as audio will be further down the line. If the audio device requires data, it will have to wait until the request is processed before the buffer is filled.</p><p>If the device drivers of higher priority components in a system are poorly implemented, this can cause delays in request scheduling and process time. This can lead to an empty audio buffer and characteristic audible pauses, pops and clicks. The DPC latency checker measures how much time is taken processing DPCs from driver invocation. The lower the value will result in better audio transfer at smaller buffer sizes. Results are measured in microseconds.</p><p><img alt="Deferred Procedure Call Latency" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph14171/dpc.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We test the DPC latency at default settings out of the box, and the ASRock board performs noticeably better than any other AMD Threadripper HEDT and EPYC focused&nbsp;model we've tested so far.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH51fZZqZq2glWKutL7OnKJmqpGYuG6xz7KanXBdZ8Fuuc6tn56qkqSus7CMq5yvoZWsfHY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-og-debra-danielsen-says-daughter-farrah-abrahams-poop-in-a-jar-sales-have-cost-her-jobs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teen Mom OG: Debra Danielsen says daughter Farrah Abrahams poop in a jar sales were a setup</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./revelations-in-new-max-documentary-shed-light-on-cold-case-of-teen-missing-for-32-years.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Revelations in new Max documentary shed light on cold case of teen missing for 32 years</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
