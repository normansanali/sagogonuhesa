"My doctor chased me for like two years, and I was like, 'No, I'm afraid of it,'" she shared. Despite her initial reservations due to thyroid concerns, Kelly found a medication that worked for her, aiding in sugar breakdown—a task her body struggled with. "Mine is a different one [medicine] than people assume, but I ended up having to do that too because my bloodwork got so bad," she added.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45ef93290750-whoopi-goldberg-smiling.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Whoopi Goldberg</h2><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Whoopi</a> has been transparent about her success with the weight loss drug Mounjaro, telling Kelly Clarkson about the significant impact it has had on her health, helping her lose the weight of "almost two people."</p><p dir=ltr>"I'm doing that wonderful shot that works for folks who need some help and it's been really good for me," she said.
