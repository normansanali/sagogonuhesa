The book has made over <strong>$4 million</strong>, but he didn't receive any earnings because the U.S government filed a lawsuit claiming that Snowden had violated a non-disclosure agreement.</p><h2>Agreed to give up more than $5 million</h2><p>As per court records, Snowden has agreed to give up more than <strong>$5 million</strong> he earned from his book and speaking fees to the United States government.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/24/Edw-1600954484719.jpg><p>As of <i>September 2020</i>, Snowden has earned <strong>$4.2 million</strong> from his book sales, royalties, and rights.

Joseph earned critical praise, but the movie grossed <strong>$37.3 million</strong> worldwide.</p><h2>Leaks of NSA Documents</h2><p>In <i>December 2012</i>, Snowden first contacted The Guardian's journalist <strong>Glenn Greenwald</strong>. In <i>January 2013</i>, he contacted documentary filmmaker <strong>Laura Poitras</strong>. So, why did Snowden chose Greenwald and Poitras to give such classified documents?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/24/NSA-1600954764130.jpg><p>Well, Snowden saw a <i>Salon</i> article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras's controversial films had made her a target of the government.</p><p>After disclosing the copied documents, Snowden said in June 2013, <i>"All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped."</i></p><h3>How much did Snowden disclose?</h3><p>After working for the CIA from 2006-2009, Snowden began working for the National Security Agency (NSA) as an employee of Dell. As per the U.S officials and other sources, he began downloading important documents describing it as government's electronic spying programs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/24/Edward-1600954897366.jpg><p>As per the investigators, Snowden gave around 50,000 to 200,000 documents to journalists, Greenwald and filmmaker, Poitras.</p><p>The exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown. While the NSA director said he had copied documents from 50,000 to 200,000, the U.S. officials estimate he copied around 1.7 million documents. Further, a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency reports stated that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files.</p><h2>Potential Impact on U.S National Security</h2><p>The Snowden documents contained highly sensitive NSA blueprints, which showed how the NSA operates. If someone would read them, then they could evade or even duplicate NSA surveillance.</p><p>In July 2015, an article published by the New York Times reported that the terror group Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) had studied revelations from Snowden about how the United States gathered information on militants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/24/Ed1-1600955026337.jpg><p>While Snowden stated he didn't turn over documents to journalists, the redaction of a document by the New York Times resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against Al-Qaeda.</p><p>On <i>June 14, 2015</i>, The Sunday Times reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than 1 million classified files in the Snowden cache. As per the result, the UK's MI6 intelligence agency was forced to move agents out of live operations in hostile countries.</p><h3>Will Snowden return to the United States?</h3><p>Since the leak of NSA documents, Snowden and his wife has been living in exile in Russia. In the past ex-president, <strong>Barack Obama</strong> tried to set a motion for pardoning him but failed to do so.</p><p>Snowden has said he would like to return to his home country but only on the condition of a fair trial. Meanwhile, President Trump has said he will <i>"take a look"</i> at pardoning Snowden. <a href=#><strong>Chuck Grassley</strong></a>, a Republican member, also defends whistleblowing.</p><h2>Family Background</h2><p>Edward Joseph Snowden was born on <i>June 21, 1983,</i> in North Carolina, the United States. His father, <strong>Lonnie Snowden,</strong> was an officer in the Coast Guard, while mother, <strong>Elizabeth,</strong> is a clerk in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.</p><p>Further, his grandfather, <strong>Edward J.
