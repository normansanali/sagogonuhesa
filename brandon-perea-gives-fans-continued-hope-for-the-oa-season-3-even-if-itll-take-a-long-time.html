Her return is shocking and miraculous, considering she left blind but came. back with sight. When the FBI tries to find out what happened to Prairie, she refuses to talk about what happened.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Season 2 ended with a bang, with Prairie jumping across universes into a new reality. Unfortunately, audiences never got to learn what came of this given that a season 3 was never released. This has been very disappointing, and even, after all this time, neither the cast nor fans have given up hope.</p><h2 id=h-could-the-oa-come-back-for-a-third-season data-injectable=false>Could The OA come back for a third season?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-36.png><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Even the series‚Äô cast and crew seem keen to get back on board. <a href=#>Nope star Brandon Perea</a> ‚Äî who portrayed French on The OA ‚Äî shared a tweet in June 2023, in which he encouraged fans to leave the door open always:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Leave your door open, always! <a href=#>#TheOA</a></p><p>Watch ‚ÄúA Murder At The End Of The World‚Äù on FX / Hulu in August to support Brit and Zal‚Äôs next venture ü´∂üèΩ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/U4qLv7G9yB</a></p>‚Äî Brandon Perea (@BrandonPerea) <a href=#>June 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=803 data-injectable=true>Perea made sure to give a shout-out to A Murder at the End of the World, a new series by <a href=#>The OA creators</a> and executive producers Brit Marling (who also starred as the titular OA) and Zal Batmanglij. The series follows an amateur sleuth and hacker named Darby Hart who are invited by a billionaire to a retreat at a remote and stunning location. A guest is found dead, leading to Darby using her skills to prove it was a murder. It premieres on November 14 on FX and will be available to stream on Hulu.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>He also included a screenshot of Marling responding to an Instagram comment. In the screenshot, Marling can be seen assuring fans that she also misses The OA, and she also teases that the show could come back someday, like Twin Peaks ‚Äî another eclectic show that ended too soon. As we all surely know, Twin Peaks had a nearly 30-year<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> hiatus</a> between its second and third seasons.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Hey, if it means Perea‚Äôs still working in front of the screen in thirty years, the silver linings outweigh the wait time. The OA really shows off Perea‚Äôs acting chops ‚Äì which are now thankfully being recognized by a wider audience after his scene-stealing turn in Nope.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>The OA‚Äòs also one of the very few shows that can pull that type of hiatus off. It‚Äôs never been a conventional show ‚Äî again, like Twin Peaks ‚Äî and Marling and Batmanglij have shown they can really pull off some very out-there ideas. Stranger things have happened.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjvsCnm6imXaWys7HAZp6irpWoeqetzaxknKeeqbavwcSdZKGnoJp6p7vRZquhnV2krm6%2FxJqqqKZdaHqmwsSnZKKeXZ7BrbiMrZiknV2Weq27zaBkraGdmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cheryl-darwin-car-collision-shocking-details-and-viral-video-spark-concern-for-her-wellbeing.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cheryl Darwin Car Collision: Shocking Details and Viral Video Spark Concern for Her Wellbeing</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-anderson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Anderson Biography, Life, Interesting Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
