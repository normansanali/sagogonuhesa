"I say that only for you people that hurt also, like I get it."&nbsp;</p><p id=e4OrwqlIlDZ data-wc=36>She carried on that this is partly due to ageing, because when you get older it hurts and "you have to stretch" - except the <a class=hm-link href=#>Legally Blonde</a> actress struggles to stretch due to her Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.</p><p id=e7YtZjfQnDJ data-wc=54>"The Ehlers-Danlos - which is something so many more people have now than I realized…" she explained.

But still I notice when I go out it's still very pronounced when I go into different rooms, hallways or meeting new people or even focusing on talking about it."</p><p id=e4XtNJpnI-w data-wc=24>But she revealed she doesn't mind talking about how strange this can be now since speaking to other people with MS and neurological issues.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef5487876ea7-gettyimages-1447285047.jpg><p id=eBa5s_AWUeR data-wc=28>One particularly heartbreaking admission from the actress was that she gets sad when people ask her what she wants to do with her life because she's so tired.</p><p id=ekY6Ka9NAgs data-wc=53>"I just want to sleep and then get on my horse and be better.
