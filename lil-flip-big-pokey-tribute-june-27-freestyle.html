Low key, humble mountain of a man who moved with honor and respect. He was easy to love and hard to hate.</p><p>“He’d pull up, do what he had to do and head home. One of the pillars of our city. If heart of gold was a person. Iconic member of the SUC. There will never be another and will be missed dearly. We love and honor you Sensei. Rest in heaven.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/03/51D26E7F-0DBC-420A-876D-7CA834C1463B-165x165.jpeg alt="Review: Lil Flip Upholds Hometown Hero Status With 'Leprechaun 2'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> review</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Review: Lil Flip Upholds Hometown Hero Status With 'Leprechaun 2'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 30, 2020</p></a><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Paul Wall shared a video of himself enjoying a Pokey performance</a>, writing: “It is with an extremely heavy heart that I make this post saying rest in peace to @sucbigpokey what a great mentor and friend.
