Pandos disappeared from her bedroom in her home in Williamsburg 32 years ago, and there are still no leads or clues after all these years. A new documentary is coming out that may change that. It’s called <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Burden of Proof</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Before we get into that, here’s a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quick refresher</a> on the case: Pandos was 15 and lived at home with her parents Margie and Ronald Pandos. She had an older brother who was away at college named Steven. On the morning of February 10, 1987, Margie Pandos didn’t hear the shower running, which was strange because it was something her daughter did every morning.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Jenny’s door was locked and when her parents opened it both their daughter and her purse were missing. There was a note on the pillow as well. The note started in the third person: “Your daughter’s with me. She’s fine. She’s having some problems and needs time away.”</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Then it switched to first person: ”I’m fine, I just need time to think. Both of you please go to work tomorrow ‘cause I will try to call you. I won’t call you at home, only at one of y’all’s work. Do not call the police. I can easily find out if you do. I may never come back home. Don’t tell my friends about this. Just tell them that I’m sick.”</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>The parents waited three days, which is very shady, and then called police. Deputy Chief Steve Rubino told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dateline NBC</a> that Jenny was left-handed and may have written the note with her left hand. Foul play was not suspected, and she remains missing to this day.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>The new documentary follows her brother as he searches for the truth of what happened. His main suspects: his parents. He thinks they did something and aren’t telling anyone what really happened.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>“I’m Jennifer’s brother,” he says in the trailer for the doc. “I’ve reached out to an attorney about whether I could sue my parents for the death of my sister.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Steven Pandos goes on to say that “everything I’ve been told was a lie” about Jenny’s disappearance. “I think my mother knows what happened and my father scared her to keep this a secret.”</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>What may be the weirdest thing in a very personal documentary is that Steve also talks to his parents about the whole thing and tells them on camera that he thinks they are involved. Heavy.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>“You really think I did it,” Steve’s father says. “Yes,” he replies. If you’re a true crime fan, I imagine you’re going to like this one.
