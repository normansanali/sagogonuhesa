He gets overly excited and tends to cut off his guests during interviews. Some let it slide, while others have put the host on the spot for it in the past. Given her close relationship with Jimmy Fallon, this was likely easier for Taylor Swift to do. The moment takes place when Swift is about to make a major reveal, but Fallon cuts her off as she's about to give the message.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fallon sets up the reveal, "Taylor Swift will be performing at the VMAs. Can you confrim of deny?" Taylor reveals, "Um... I mean we've had a really good time today..." Fallon interjects, "Taylor, Taylor."</p><p>Swift then interjects and says, "Can you see where I am going with this at least. Nobody ever listens to me. Finish a thought." She continues, "So what I was saying, is that I said a good time, and it was such a bonding experience, and that I was going to be playing at the VMAs."</p><p>Swift maintains her stone-cold look after making the announcement, while Jimmy Fallon brags that he got the scoop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-16t112717-769.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Had The Entire Room In Tears When She Showed Up For A Surprise Performance At A Wedding</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The wedding guests needed a second to gather themselves after Taylor Swift's shocking appearance.</span><p>As expected, fans were blasting Jimmy Fallon in the comments section following the interview moment.</p><p>The top comments read, "Nobody ever let's me finish," Kanye reverberates in the distance."</p><p>Another fan wrote, "I can’t help but feel bad for her, so many interviewers push her beyond her limits, are rude and ask intrusive questions. And sometimes it’s too much and your feelings bubble up, I can’t blame her."</p><p>In truth, it wasn't the only time things went sideways during her appearance on the Tonight Show.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-had-other-uncomfortable-interview-moments-with-jimmy-fallon>Taylor Swift Had Other Uncomfortable Interview Moments With Jimmy Fallon</h2><p>There are other moments that showed the vulnerable side of Taylor Swift during her time alongside Jimmy Fallon. The host once <a href=#>went off-script and showed footage Swift wasn't expecting</a>.</p><p>The footage showed the behind the scenes of what Swift's eye surgery was like. Swift's mom took the secret footage, hilariously documenting her daughter's struggles. Taylor was shocked by the footage but had a good laugh over it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-08t095534-787.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_the-snl-moment-that-changed-taylor-swift-s-career_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Seth Meyers Regretted The Way He Handled Taylor Swift's Monologue During Her SNL Appearance</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Seth Meyers agreed with Howard Stern that Taylor Swift' has a "problematic" experience hosting SNL at 19.</span><p>On the flip side, Taylor and Jimmy also shared special moments together.

But we wanted something special for this first show back, so we asked her on a complete whim, since she had been in town doing SNL.

Suddenly she sings the line, ‘Squeeze my hand 3 times in the back of the taxi.’ I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing. I could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue. We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. ‘Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you,’ Taylor sang.”</p><p>A special moment and one Jimmy Fallon won't forget.</p><h2 id=dakota-johnson-was-another-star-that-put-jimmy-fallon-on-blast-for-interrupting>Dakota Johnson Was Another Star That Put Jimmy Fallon On Blast For Interrupting</h2><p>Looking back, there's a lot of evidence of Jimmy Fallon interrupting guests.

Clearly, she hasn't been afraid to tell it as it is in the past. Who can forget her iconic appearance on Ellen, putting the host on blast for not attending her party.</p><p>As for her time with Jimmy Fallon, Johnson took quite the dig at the host. She said, "Aren't you supposed to let people talk on this show."</p><p>Fans had a blast with the interview moment as Dakota once again was completely honest during the interview, spilling the truth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llqS%2FbrzUrauippdit6q5zLJkn5mcobyvecinZKGho2K9ra3CnmSanqSav260xGagp6yVp7%2B2vNOem2aglad6tLzEnKCapF2nsrexwKVm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./j-r-smith-fights-man-who-allegedly-broke-window-at-protest-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>J.R.
