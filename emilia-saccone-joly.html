Also, her video of herself singing was too cute and went viral.</p><h4>YouTube Story</h4><p>The adorable child had stepped into the YouTube community right from the time she was born. She always had a connection with this video-sharing community as she was born to YouTuber parents. Similarly, when her mother, Anna, was pregnant with her, she confirmed the news to the viewers through a vlog, and after that, the couple regularly vlogged about the pregnancy. They had even the gender reveal ceremony to the delivery, the ‘Saccone-Joly’ couple captured every moment of Emilia’s arrival.</p><p>Likewise, as soon after her birth, her parents introduced her to the viewers through the video titled; ‘Lives Changed Forever.’ Shooting the birth turned out to be a bit of a task for Emilia’s parents as the hospital management had some objection to carrying a camera to the labor room. Later, the management even asked for a written apology and explanation for the act. Besides this, the family faced hatred and trolls from several other organizations.</p><p>These Irish organizations had problems with the family as they revealed too much about their personal lives. Similarly, they had even received death threats. Because of this, the whole family later shifted to England.
