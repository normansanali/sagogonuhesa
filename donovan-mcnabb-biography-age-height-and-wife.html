Donovan McNabb was born on November 25, 1976 in Chicago, Illinois. He is a former quarterback for the Washington Redskins and, most famously, the Philadelphia Eagles. He was a six time Pro-Bowl Selection, and was been chosen as Big East Offensive Player of the Year three times. When people talk about great NFL football quarterbacks, the name of Donovan McNabb must be mentioned. A former second pick overall in the 1999 draft, McNabb was quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999 to 2009. He spent the 2010 year with the Redskins and the 2011 year with the Vikings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=donovan-mcnabb-hall-of-fame></span><span>Donovan Mcnabb Hall Of Fame</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He continues to be of the belief that he deserves to be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>“Absolutely,”&nbsp;McNabb told TMZ Sports. “I’m not hesitating on that. I am a Hall of Famer. My numbers speak for itself. … My numbers are better than&nbsp;Troy Aikman, but he has Super Bowl rings and he’s played with Hall of Famers as well.”</p><p>It is&nbsp;not the first time&nbsp;that McNabb has said he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame and has compared his numbers to those of Aikman, the former&nbsp;Dallas Cowboys&nbsp;quarterback who won three Super Bowls.</p><p>McNabb spent 11 of his 13 NFL seasons with the&nbsp;Philadelphia Eagles. In 167 career games, he completed 59 percent of his 5,374 pass attempts for 37,276 yards and 234 touchdowns.</p><p>By comparison, Aikman threw for 32,942 yards and 165 touchdowns.</p><p>McNabb was asked again if his statistics were good enough to warrant Hall of Fame induction and why he thought it hasn’t happened.</p><p>“When they look at my numbers, yeah,” McNabb told TMZ Sports, “but then they always want to add other stuff into it. ‘Was he an All-Pro? Was he this? How many Super Bowl opportunities?’ But people don’t realize how hard it is to get to the NFC Championship. And to get there five times, then make it to a Super Bowl? It’s tough.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=donovan-mcnabb-college></span><span>Donovan Mcnabb College</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>McNabb was approached by recruiters from numerous colleges, only two schools, Syracuse University and the University of Nebraska, offered him scholarships to play college football as a quarterback. He initially leaned toward attending Nebraska, as he relished the idea of being coached by Tom Osborne. Eventually, however, he decided to attend Syracuse and play for the Syracuse Orange football team, principally because he wanted to prove he was a competent “pocket passer”, but also for their broadcasting journalism program.</p><p>After redshirting in 1994, his first year at Syracuse, McNabb went on to start every game during his college career, compiling a 35–14 record.As a freshman, he completed the longest touchdown pass in Syracuse’s history—a 96-yard throw against West Virginia University—in a game where he accounted for 354 total yards of offense;he was named the Big East Conference’s rookie of the year at the end of the season. McNabb amassed 2,892 yards of total offense in his junior season to set a school record.As a senior, he led Syracuse to a berth in the Orange Bowl against Florida, as he completed 157 of 251 passes (62.5%) for 2,134 yards; he also pushed the eventual champions, the 1998 Tennessee Volunteers, to the limit in a very close game. His 22 touchdown passes tied the school’s single-season record, set by former Eagle Don McPherson in 1987. McNabb also rushed 135 times for 438 yards and eight touchdowns. He ranked sixth in the nation with a 158.9 passing efficiency rating and 22nd in total offense, with 233.8 yards per game. He tied a school record with four touchdown passes against Cincinnati, and scored five touchdowns against Miami (three rushings and two passing). McNabb was also teammates with future NFL star Marvin Harrison for one season at Syracuse.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=donovan-mcnabb-philadelphia-eagles></span><span>Donovan Mcnabb Philadelphia Eagles</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was drafted in the first round with the second overall pick by the Eagles, behind first pick Tim Couch, in the 1999 NFL Draft. McNabb was the second of five quarterbacks selected in the first 12 picks of a quarterback-rich class that was at that point considered the best quarterback draft since the famous class of 1983. However, only McNabb and Daunte Culpepper went on to have successful careers in the NFL; Tim Couch struggled with the Cleveland Browns and officially retired in 2007 after being cut by the Jacksonville Jaguars in a failed comeback bid, while Akili Smith and Cade McNown were out of the NFL by 2002. By 2006, only McNabb was still with the team that originally drafted him.</p><p>McNabb saw his first NFL regular season action in the second half against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 19-5 home loss on September 19. He made his first career start at home against Washington on November 14, completing eight of 21 passes for 60 yards in a 35-28 win. He also had nine carries for 49 rushing yards and led the team to a pair of successful two-point conversions (one rush and one pass). He was the first Eagles rookie to start at quarterback since Brad Goebel, and the first Eagles rookie draft pick to start since John Reaves in 1972. With the win, McNabb became the first Eagles rookie quarterback to win his first NFL start since Mike Boryla (December 1, 1974, against Green Bay) and the first Eagle quarterback to win his first start since Ty Detmer (October 13, 1996, against the New York Giants)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=donovan-mcnabb-rush-limbaugh></span><span>Donovan Mcnabb Rush Limbaugh</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>McNabb has have been to three straight&nbsp;Bowls and two consecutive NFC championship games, and was<br>runner-up for NFL MVP in his first full season as a starter.</p><p>Still, commentator Rush Limbaugh saw fit to question the quarterback’s credentials.</p><p>Before McNabb led the Philadelphia Eagles to a 23-13 victory<br>over the Buffalo Bills, Limbaugh said on ESPN’s “Sunday NFL<br>Countdown” that McNabb is overrated. However, Limbaugh injected his comment with racial overtones that have set off a controversy.</p><p>“Sorry to say this, I don’t think he’s been that good from the get-go,” Limbaugh<br>said. “I think what we’ve had here is a little social concern in<br>the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback<br>do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a<br>lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn’t<br>deserve. The defense carried this team.”</p><p>ESPN released an official statement Wednesday night.</p><p>“Although Mr. Limbaugh today stated that his comments had ‘no racist intent whatsoever,’ we have communicated to Mr. Limbaugh that his comments were insensitive and inappropriate. Throughout his career, he has been consistent in his criticism of the media’s coverage of a myriad of issues,” the statement read.</p><p>Earlier, ESPN executive vice president Mark Shapiro came to the conservative Limbaugh’s defense.</p><p>“This is not a politically motivated comment. This is a sports and media argument,” Shapiro was quoted as saying in a USA Today column published Wednesday. “Rush was arguing McNabb is essentially overrated and that his success is more in part [due] to the team assembled around him.</p><p>“We brought Rush in for no-holds-barred opinion. Early on, he has delivered,” Shapiro told USA Today.</p><p>ESPN spokesman Dave Nagle said Tuesday that Limbaugh doesn’t do interviews.</p><p>“It’s sad that you’ve got to go to skin color. I thought we were through with that whole deal,” McNabb told the Philadelphia Daily News.</p><p>Limbaugh’s remarks could be considered as untimely as they are thought to be out of bounds. He is scheduled to be in Philadelphia on Thursday to give a keynote address at the three-day National Association of Broadcasters radio convention.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=donovan-mcnabb-teams></span><span>Donovan Mcnabb Teams</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>career, he played football and basketball for Syracuse University.
