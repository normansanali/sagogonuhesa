長く応援してきたファンを騒がせていますが、その後、すぐにアドミンさん本人の謝罪動画が投稿されています。
これまでにもゲーム実況での炎上事件は多数ありましたす、実況中にリスナを非難、自分がコメント欄で非難されたりが大抵の原因です。
しかし、今回のアドミンさんの炎上の理由は過去ある炎上とは少し違った内容です。
子共じみてるといういうか、果たして本当にプロのゲーム配信者がやったことか？と驚きます。
アドミンが炎上の理由→仲悪いトナカイトをコーチ説明中に無言で殺しまくる 2021年6月24日の時点での炎上の話です。
アドミンさんがゲーム配信中にとんでもない行動に出て大炎上しているとのことですが、その内容について簡潔に振り返ってみたいと思います。
現在の時点でアドミンさんの炎上の理由となった場面が乗っている動画は非公開になっています。
しかし、炎上するまでの経歴自体はツイッターに残っています。

— Luxarei😈@サムライマック (@metametamooooon) June 20, 2021 要は、アドミンさんがコーツの説明中に、無言で味方の「トナカイト」さんを殺し続けたということです。
アドミンさんはコーチ説明が終わるまで、ずっとトナカイトさんを殺し続けたのです。
しかし、自分の配信ではコーチの話をまったく聞かず、ご飯をクチャクチャ食べながら、自分のリスナーと関係ない話（自分のキャラの話）をしていたそうです。
アドミンとトナカイトは昔から不仲で絶縁状態の過去があった？ なぜ、関係ないところでトナカイトさんは殺されまくったのか・・・。
実はシンプルにアドミンさんがトナカイトのことが大っ嫌いということが理由だと憶測されてます。
そりゃ、好きな人に対してあんなことしないですよね。
アドミンは謝罪動画の中で引退を検討？ ちなみに6月23日にアドミンが謝罪動画を投稿していました。
動画の内容は、お酒の席でリスナーの愚痴を言ったことに対する謝罪で、トナカイトさんに対する謝罪ではありませんでした。
嫌いが故に素直になれない意地でしょうか？
動画では配信されているのに、人としての配慮もなく自分に非があったこと、配信外であれば問題なかったものの、たくさんのリスナーが聞いていたところであんな態度を取りリスナーに不快な思いをさせたことをメインに謝罪。
自分のリスナーに対しては、しっかりと悔やんでいます。
ちなみに、過去にトナカイトとトラブルがあり共演NGだったことは否定していました。NG疑惑についてはデマだそうです。
アドミンさんは今後のゲーム実況の活動については引退も検討してるそうです。
アドミンさんが一番落ち込んでいたのは、Apex Legendsを中心としたゲーム実況チームのKNR(このり)のブランドを傷つけてしまったとです。
完全にソロで活動をするかもしれないと。一応は、この後メンバーとの話し合って決めるそうです。

ラッドと肩を並べて著名なワンオク。
メンバーは３０代前後でありながらも、
その別格なロックサウンドは、
多くの邦楽バンドマンのベテランに絶賛されてます。
そんなワンオクのメンバーは、
皆、レベルが高くライブが好評ですが、
Tomoyaさんは天才と評され、
さらには、可愛い優しい笑顔が大人気です。
技術もヴィジュアルのも良いのが、
ワンオクの魅力の１つだと言えますが、
今年２０１７年はメンバーの結婚ラッシュが続いてます。
Tomoyaさんは限っては、
昨日の６月９日に、
結婚したことをメディアに発表しました。
ロックバンド・ONE OK ROCKのドラマー・Tomoya（29）が9日、自身のインスタグラムで結婚したことを発表した。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20170609-00000383-oric-ent
アイドル人気だけではないので、
ワンオクの評判にマイナスはないと思いますが、
少なからず、一部の女性ファンは悲鳴をあげてることでしょうね！
バンドマンを応援するのは、
アイドルを追いかけるのと違って、
メンバーの色恋を認めなければ、
他ファンから批判を浴びるので、
嫉妬心を隠すのは辛いものです・・・。
最近のウーバーファンも、
メンバーの結婚ラッシュに、
ちょっとかわいそうですが、
ワンオクも同じくです・・・。
Tomoyaが結婚発表。相手(嫁)の名前と顔(画像・写真) Tomoyaさんはインスタにて、
自身が結婚したことを発表しましたが、
気になるのは、結婚相手の女性です。
モテモテのワンオクメンバーとして、
どのような女性と結ばれたのが？
ベースのryotaさんの嫁さんが、
アヴリルの妹だったということで、
かなりビッグな女性である可能性があります。
ボーカルの英語の発音が評判ですが、
メンバーの家族構成が海外志向になるほど、
今後、長く同じ価値観で活動できるのかと、
皆、同じ方向に向いてるようで微笑ましいです。
インスタでは「みなさんにお伝えしたいことがあります」と切り出し「個人的な報告になってしまうのですが、結婚しました!!」と報告。今後へ向け「幸せな家庭を築いていきながら、ONE OK ROCKのドラマーとしても今まで以上に頑張っていきたいと思います!!これからも末長く、よろしくね」とファンに呼びかけている。
同バンドは、ベースのRyota（27）が今年2月、カナダ出身の歌手アヴリル・ラヴィーンの妹、ミシェルさんとの結婚を発表している。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20170609-00000383-oric-ent
Tomoyaさんの嫁さんは日本人なのでしょうか？
今のバンドの状況を考えると、
英語が堪能な才女か、もしくは、
将来的に海外での生活を受け入れてくれる女性であるべきです。
バンドを破滅させるのは女だとは、
昔からよく言います。
ビートルズのオノヨーコさんしかり、
メンバーの誰かの価値観に大きく影響を与えるからです。
ロックバンドが向かいたい場所に、
メンバーの嫁さんが付いてきてくれるのか・・。
これから海外でガンガンと名前を売っていく、
ワンオクの状況にて、
各嫁さんの存在が、支えになるのか、そうでないのか、
男性のファンにとっては関心深い部分でもあります。
Tomoyaと嫁の馴れ初めと交際期間第一子や子供は？過去の彼女 Tomoyaさんの結婚相手の女性は、
名前が出ていないということで、
一般人の可能性が高いですが、
一部では、元グラビアアイドルという憶測もあります。</description></item><item><title>U-Anderson Cooper Partner, Ubani umyeni wakhe?
