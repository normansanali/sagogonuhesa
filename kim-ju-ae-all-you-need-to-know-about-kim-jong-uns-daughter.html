She was born in 2013 making her 8 years old as of 2021. The exact day of birth have been difficult to pin down, but can be roughly inferred from the lengthy periods in which Ri, Ju-ae’s mother mysteriously vanished from public life. Little is known about the girl and her family as they are very secretive about family matters. And even less is known about the three young children the couple is believed to have.</p><p>Most of the currently available information about Kim Ju-ae and the family comes from South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. But former US basketball star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dennis Rodman has also spoken to media</a>&nbsp;about holding one of Kim’s children during one of his controversial visits to the Hermit Kingdom, though the details he provided have not been independently corroborated.</p><p>The leader of the North Korean country’s first child is believed to be a boy, born in 2010, and his second child a daughter- Kim Ju-ae born in 2013. The fact that Kim has at least one male heir likely means that he could eventually succeed Kim to continue the family’s dynasty.</p><p>The gender of Kim Ju-ae’s other <a href=# rel=noopener>sibling remains unknown</a>. The child is believed to have been born in February 2017. There are no public photos of Kim and Ri’s children, but the couple do occasionally pose for propaganda photos with other people’s kids, like in this photo at a children’s hospital in 2014.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kim Ju-ae mother’s , Ri Sol-ju</h2><p>According to analyst Cheong Seong-chang, Ms Ri hails from an upper-class household, with her father being a professor and her mother being an obstetrician.</p><p>According to sources, Ms Ri, who is said to be 31 years old, was a member of the Unhasu Orchestra, an elite ensemble whose members are selected by the government.</p><p>Mr Cheong goes on to say that she is thought to have married Mr Kim in 2009, with the late Kim Jong-il hastily arranging the wedding after he had a stroke in 2008.</p><p>According to analyst Cheong Seong-chang, Ms Ri hails from an upper-class household, with her father being a professor and her mother being an obstetrician.</p><p>According to sources, Ms Ri, who is said to be 31 years old, was a member of the Unhasu Orchestra, an elite ensemble whose members are selected by the government.</p><p>Mr Cheong goes on to say that she is thought to have married Mr Kim in 2009, with the late Kim Jong-il hastily arranging the wedding after he had a stroke in 2008.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXCsqurnZ6ZwG%2BvzqZmpKGdYre2ecCeZJqknGLGsMGMp5yenF2pvG63zaiuZpmSpMK1ecqipGain6O0bsHNrGSdmaWctbWx0Wg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kinky-friedman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kinky Friedman</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-a-horse-racing-jockey-earn-in-a-month.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Does A Horse Racing Jockey Earn In A Month?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
