Gates was recently spotted attending <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>'s LA tour stop. In a clip that recently surfaced online, the "2 Phones" rapper appears to be enjoying himself during Drake's set. Following a quick intermission, Drake noticed Gates in the crowd and embraced him. The pair quickly dapped it up before the "Nonstop" rapper resumed his performance.</p><p>The last time the two names were mentioned together was during <a href=# rel>YNW Melly's murder trial</a>. An undercover cop ended up mentioning the rappers during his testimony regarding the violent content in their lyrics. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Juelz Santana</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Thug</a>, and French Montana were also among those referenced.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-kicked-off-his-it-s-all-a-blur-tour-in-july>Drake Kicked Off His "It's All A Blur Tour"&nbsp;In July</h2></span><p>Drake's latest trek started last month, and it has already broken records. Drake earned $5 million each night at Capital One Arena, making him the first rapper to earn that amount in a single performance. Spanning 54 dates across the US and Canada, the tour&nbsp;will run until October. There will be stops in notable cities like Inglewood, Toronto, and more. The tour has featured various special guests so far, including&nbsp;Lil Yachty and, most recently,&nbsp;<a href=# class=text-word rel>Meek Mill</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In other news, Kevin Gates recently came back to Instagram to send a message to his followers. In a clip posted to his official page, the rapper seems to be relaxing in the ocean as he speaks directly to the camera. He had quite a bit to say. “Let the record reflect," he began. "[If] [you] ever did me dirty when I wasn’t nothing but genuine with you people… Hey, I forgive you. I didn’t understand it when I was going through it, but I thank you." He continued: “‘Cause y’all… provoked me to be something that I never, ever thought I could be... I’m gonna step away for a while, and I’m gonna have my executive assistant take care of my affairs." He added, "Hey, but do me two favors...Find me two n*ggas. Find me that n*gga that could say I told on him, and find me that n*gga that could say he stuck his d*ck in me."</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Who Is Kevin Gates?
