So, it wasn't a record executive's decision to slap a new moniker on her.</p><p>In fact, <strong>the singer had the stage name when she first performed at about 14 years old</strong>. As multiple sources have revealed, a young Alecia was taunted with the name before she made it her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After releasing her album M!ssundaztood, Pink explained how she came up with the name that would become famous with her: <strong>"It's just a nickname that's been following me my whole life.

It became an identity she could (and wanted to) work with. As LiveAbout recapped, most of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pink's early albums played off her feelings of insecurity</a> and needing to live up to society's standards for a pop star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar49189270-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From "Don't Let Me Get Me," which was about not wanting to conform to being marketed like Britney Spears, to "Sober" about getting past her need to drink to be socially accepted, Pink evidently pours her emotions into her music.</p><p>Not only does her name buck trends (while also being at odds with her iconic bad-girl appearance), but her songs spoke to fans in a way that has endured over the years.</p><p>As of 2024, Pink is on tour for her latest album, Trustfall.
