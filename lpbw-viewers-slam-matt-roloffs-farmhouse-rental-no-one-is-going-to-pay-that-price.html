Instead, he removed the listing from the market and is offering his and Amy’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former home for rent</a>.</p><p>The 5,300-square foot home boasts a pool, in-ground hot tub, two game rooms, and views of Roloff Farms’ 109 sprawling acres.</p><p>The home has been completely remodeled and is fully furnished, with a price tag of $1,141 per night with a three-night minimum stay.</p><p>LPBW fans took to Reddit after seeing the listing and gave their two cents regarding what the home offers and whether they felt it was worth the asking price.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-little-people-big-world-fans-bash-matt-roloff-s-farmhouse-rental-price>Little People, Big World fans bash Matt Roloff’s farmhouse rental price</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thread</a> included a photo of ITrip Vacations’ Instagram listing, and LPBW viewers took to the comments section to sound off, where many felt Matt’s rental is overly priced and doesn’t have much to offer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LPBW-comments-on-Reddit.jpg><p>One LPBW viewer mentioned another TLC show about little people, 7 Little Johnstons, and felt the home would make a good place for their family to film. Other than that, however, they said the property has “too much forbidden land for the average renter in the middle of Oregon.”</p><p>As mentioned in the listing, although the farm and its amenities are visible from the rental home, none are accessible to guests.</p><p>Another critic called Matt a “dumba**” for not cutting his family members a deal on the north side of the farm. As LPBW fans know, twin brothers Jeremy and Zach Roloff each threw their hat in the ring to make a bid on the property, but neither of their offers was satisfactory, according to Matt. Their disagreements have since led to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tension among the Roloff family</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Roloff-Farms-listing-1-1.jpg><p>Pointing out the large family portrait at the base of the staircase — which includes Matt, Amy, and their four kids during happier times — another LPBW fan sarcastically commented, “I love the massive family photo in the foyer… like that would be a gut punch every time you saw it… since the family isn’t on great terms and definitely not together like that anymore.”</p><p>“Matt and [Caryn] must think this place is Graceland and some iconic home that people are dying to come stay at. Sorry Matt, no one is going to pay that price,” complained another Redditor, pointing out the limited access to the farm’s amenities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot_20221121_191423_Reddit.jpg><p>Matt pulled the farmhouse listing off the market after it sat for months <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">without any offers</a>. His initial asking price while it was still listed for sale was a whopping $4 million.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">His hope with the “Plan B”</a> rental is that “many families will be able to pull together and have family reunions in this home.”</p><p>Little People, Big World airs on Tuesdays at 9/8c on TLC and Discovery+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5ylr7h51aKcsJ2iqHq0uMCmZKaZpKl6s7vLqJ2fq12brrO5x6isrJ1dp7KvwMClZKenXaS7pnnIrGSgp5mjtG7AzmanmrFdqbWiwIypqaKblWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-modine-stated-that-he-want-to-join-the-cast-of-stranger-things-as-martin-brenner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Modine Stated That He Want To Join The Cast Of Stranger Things As Martin Brenner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lemon-detox-diet-plan-rejuvenate-body-mind.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lemon Detox Diet Plan Rejuvenate Your Body and Mind</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
