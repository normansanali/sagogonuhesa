His parents inspired all of Hooker’s dedicated work. His dad’s influence and mentoring during the youth ministry at their church has helped him realize he is able to spread the gospel through football.</p><h2 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=c5debac6-99d7-4be8-9ba5-d73577a7f497>Here are 5 things to know about Tennessee’s</h2><h3>1.

Some of the most notable teams were North Carolina State, Colorado, Ohio State, and Northwestern. Hooker stuck with Tennessee partly because Josh Heupel had just been hired as head coach.</p><p class=mb-2.5 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=75af57e2-203f-450a-b4c1-fd6567c70877>Coach Heupel is another Heisman Finalist, the second in line behind Chris Weinke (Former Florida State Quarterback and Tennessee Quarterback Coach). My God has really paved the way and laid out everything for me to be successful,” Hooker said to Sons of Saturday. “Finally, I am looking forward to starting my journey here and making some plays on the field.”</p><h3 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=1c2d08e9-59a5-43cc-b9f8-9490d6462f53>2.

He’s not only one of the most talented quarterbacks in the entire NCAA with his play but also one of Tennessee’s and Sec’s finest. Despite not starting in the season-opener, Hooker is now one of the most surprising stars in any program. Check out the statistics. Hooker’s Quarterback Ranking of 185.87 is the fifth highest in the country. Ole Miss’ Matt Corral ranks sixth with a rating of 182.23.
