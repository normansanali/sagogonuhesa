The CR House & Company website offered paid services and claimed it was featured on news networks like CNN, Fox News and BBC.</p><p>Authorities inquired Utah’s Department of Professional Licensing about Lierd’s status as a nurse practitioner or registered nurse in Utah.</p><p>According to the affidavit, there were four separate applications under Lierd’s name to become a registered nurse and all were denied. One of the denied applications listed Lierd as a graduate of Nightingale College of Nursing with an Associate’s Degree in Nursing in 2015.</p><p>Authorities searched databases from four states where Lierd was associated and failed to find a record of Lierd being a nurse practitioner or a registered nurse. Another search with Nursys, a national database of nurse licenses, also showed no results of Lierd being a registered nurse anywhere in the U.S.</p><p>“From Sep. 10, 2020, to (Sept. 15), (Lierd) misrepresented herself as a licensed registered nurse, medical doctor, and nurse practitioner,” the affidavit stated. “(Lierd) falsely stated that she held a position with the United Nations and was featured on BBC News.”</p><p>Lierd also falsely claimed she was a business owner who had founded several multi-million dollar companies.</p><p>According to the affidavit, Exitus raised over $1,600,000 since 2020 due to Lierd’s misleading and false information she made. CR House & Company entered two business contracts totaling over $8,000 and $29,600 in unsettled payments.</p><p>Authorities also cite Lierd’s continued misleading as she gave a video presentation for the BYU Anti-Human Trafficking Club and handled controlled substances in medical kits to provide care to multiple Ukraine orphans while being transported to the U.S.</p><p>According to the affidavit, Lierd forged multiple documents that identified her as a nurse from the Utah Department of Professional Licensing and MountainStar St. Mark’s Hospital.</p><p>Authorities issued a search warrant on a laptop belonging to Exitus that “held photographs of a Utah (driver’s license), a black and white U.S. passport, full-color U.S. passport, and U.S. passport card” of Lierd. The two passports had different serial numbers and dates of birth.</p><p>In three interviews with people closely associated with Lierd, they told authorities she had the ability to forge passports, checks and bank records.</p><p>The affidavit stated that Lierd had hundreds of thousands of missing money from the Exitus bank account and several suspicious purchases from 2020 to 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijo6HBt3rCqKRobWhsgnKCjp6voqylqHqksc5mmKuqlajBprCMn6arZZGhuaazxJ2jsmWWlriqusZmpa6qo567qHnCq5ydnZ6ptqK40maYp5xdora0uMSam6Kml2K2r8LErKuoqqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fords-electric-vehicle-unit-losing-billions-as-company-invests-in-new-technology.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fords electric vehicle unit losing billions, as company invests in new technology</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./crucial-announces-mx200-bx100-ssds-ssd-toolbox.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Crucial Announces MX200, BX100 SSDs &amp;amp; SSD Toolbox</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
