Just weeks after dropping one sad heartbreak album, the singer found love again. But why was her new relationship with Adam Faze raising eyebrows? And how did Olivia react to fans hating her boyfriend? <a href=#>Here is the truth about Olivia's boyfriend</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Olivia and Adam were first spotted together in June 2021 at the Space Jam: A New Legacy event at Six Flags. Fans immediately suspected that they were more than just friends. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> that Olivia took Adam as her plus one to the Space Jam 2 event and introduced him as her boyfriend. The insider said, "Olivia was in great spirits celebrating Space Jam 2 last night. They were really cute together and weren't trying to hide their affection at all." The source also added that the two were together the entire night and were seen holding hands at one point. As for how the Good 4 U singer and Adam started dating, the insider revealed they met through industry friends. Stuart Brazell, who was also at the event, told the outlet that the couple was adorable but not too overly touchy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-adam-faze>Who Is Adam Faze?</h2><p><a href=#>Olivia turned 18 in 2021, and being linked to Adam, a 24-year-old, definitely raised eyebrows</a>. Many fans were wondering: Who really is Adam Faze? Is there anything out of the ordinary people should know? Well, both Adam's Twitter and Instagram accounts are private, but that doesn't mean that fans couldn't get details about him.</p><p>After a bit of digging, fans discovered that Adam wrote for Forbes magazine in 2017. Back then, he described himself as a creative entrepreneur focused on one thing only: The future of entertainment. At the time, he was 20 years old, and that's how fans knew he was around 24 when he was linked to Olivia.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Detail Might Explain The Olivia Rodrigo And Courtney Love Controversy</a></span></p><p>In March 2020, Adam started a production company: Must B Nice with Jamie Dolan. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a statement</a>, he said, "We could not be more excited to be launching 'must b nice' at a time where the line between the technology and entertainment industries is blurring. We look forward to embracing that change and working with a new generation of storytellers to push the boundary of what stories are told and how they're distributed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Together Adam and Jamie made and distributed podcasts. Their most popular piece, Day by Day, created quite the buzz. According to reports, he also started the production company phase in the first project under the company Who Am I? It was an experimental indie starring 13 Reasons Why actors Alisha Boe and Brandon Flynn. Adam also notably directed Nothing Good, Goody Grace's music video featuring G-Eazy and Juicy J. Hard work can be really attractive, and fans are guessing that is one of the traits Olivia totally fell for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-are-concerned-about-the-age-difference-between-olivia-rodrigo-and-adam-faze>Fans Are Concerned About the Age Difference Between Olivia Rodrigo and Adam Faze</h2><p>The couple basically confirmed they were dating during the July 10th through 11th weekend, when they were spotted in Los Angeles holding on to each other as they leaned on an Audi. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They were also photographed sharing a sweet kiss</a> which confirmed the relationship. However, fans were not exactly pleased with the big news.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote, "Olivia Rodrigo and Adam Faze is eyebrow-raising. She literally JUST became legal and graduated high school. He's already done with university. It's a bit weird."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Olivia Rodrigo Working On A Second Album Yet?</a></span></p><p>The fact that Olivia wasn't the only Hollywood star dating a much older man was more disturbing for other people. One fan wrote, "We need to have a serious conversation about how young girls and women in Hollywood are constantly exploited by grown men while their parents do absolutely NOTHING to intervene."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-are-worried-that-olivia-rodrigo-is-moving-on-too-fast-in-her-private-life>Fans Are Worried That Olivia Rodrigo Is Moving On Too Fast in Her Private Life</h2><p>Meanwhile, other people spoke in defense of Olivia in her relationship with one fan noting, "Olivia Rodrigo and Adam Faze are two consenting adults who happen to be six years apart. Yes, sometimes gr**ming happens with age gaps, but that's not always the case. It often has to do with where you're at in life, maturity-wise. If they're legal and a good match, them leave them alone."</p><p>Unfortunately, the age difference wasn't the only thing followers were concerned about. Fans also said that the Happier singer moved on a little too fast and probably didn't get into the new relationship with the right intentions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Olivia was previously linked to her High School Musical: The Musical: The Serie co-star Joshua Bassett</a>, but none confirmed or denied that they were ever together. However, there was an entire love triangle going on after their alleged breakup.</p><p>The singer takes her privacy very seriously, and although she may not be so forthcoming about her love life, fans are hopeful that her future songs will spill the tea.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Rodrigo Details The ‘Strange’ Gift President Biden Gave Her</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5uvs6dqaKfn2KvsMXFq6CeppRirqWtzGadmrKVYsSpu4yiqmaglWLApK3NnZilZZGcsm6wyJ%2BdnqqVo7Cmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./twitch-mboze-biography-net-worth-girlfriend-age-real-name-instagram.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Twitch: MBoZe Biography , Net Worth, Girlfriend Age, Real Name &amp;amp; Instagram</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ted-white-passed-away-at-the-age-of-96.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ted White Passed Away At The Age Of 96</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
