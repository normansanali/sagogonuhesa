In his early teenage years, he starred in many TV commercials before moving up the ladder. His first appearance was in the 2010 short Fresh 2 Death. He later went on to appear in the TV series Melissa & Joey and the film Cousin Sarah in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just a year later, he managed to land a life-changing role as Ryder Lynn in the Fox musical comedy-drama show called Glee. It was this role that would go on to open many more doors for the LA-based actor.</p><p>Since then, Jenner has gone on to star in The Edge of Seventeen (2016), Everybody Wants Some!! Everybody Wants Some!! (2016), American Animals (2018), Billy Boy (2017), and the TV series What/If.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=# title="Why Are There So Many 'Glee' References In 'The Girl From Plainville'?">Why Are There So Many 'Glee' References In 'The Girl From Plainville'?</a></span></p><p>Starring in such a wide range of shows and movies has allowed Jenner to build up his work portfolio and at the same time, build his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.5 million net worth</a> that he sits on today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-glee-star-blake-jenner-arrested>Why Was Glee Star Blake Jenner Arrested?</h2><p>More recently, the 29-year-old actor has been getting himself in hot water.

On July 9th, he was pulled over after officers spotted him failing to come to a stop at a red light.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=# title="What Has 'Glee' Star Dianna Agron Been Working On Recently?">What Has 'Glee' Star Dianna Agron Been Working On Recently?</a></span></p><p>Once pulled over, Jenner apparently displayed "objective signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication", according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burbank Police Department</a>. After performing a field sobriety test, he was charged. He is due to appear in court at a later date and was later released from custody after being arrested. Since then, no more news has been released regarding the event.</p><p>Fans certainly weren't shy about airing their opinions on the matter online. One fan wrote:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, it seems some fans aren't feeling best pleased about his actions.

Just two years ago in 2020, Jenner took to his Instagram to post a heartfelt message, addressing domestic violence allegations concerning his ex-wife Melissa Benoist.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">heartfelt explanation</a> spanned a total of six pages, and it seemed as though Jenner clearly had a lot to get off his chest in regard to the situation. He began by explaining that he has been reflecting on how to handle the situation and that he now felt that it was an issue that needed to be addressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Throughout that time, I reflected on a period in my life that I had previously kept in the darkness out of shame and fear, but I know this is something that needs to be addressed, not just publicly, but also privately with the individual directly affected and with myself."</p><p>He then proceeds to open up about his former relationship with his wife, explaining elements of their relationship for the public. He actually dives into quite some detail.</p><p>"When I was 20 years old, I met a woman and we fell in love. I didn't realize the magnitude of it back then, but in retrospect, as great as the love that was shared between us, the shared brokenness that stemmed from our childhoods proved to be greater."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The post then dives into further depth and detail. His ex-wife also opened up about the situation, detailing on a video on Instagram how she thought she'd 'never be sharing a story like this'.</p><p>She has since gone on to share her side of the story in hopes of helping other people in the same situation as her. Since then, neither side seems to of spoken publicly about the issue again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60ecalnJ5lo6mus3nBpZiknV2fsq%2B6xKtkmqqimsC1scNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-smith-daughter-willow-smith-wows-jaw-dropping-bikini-photo-dreamy-vacation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Willow Smith is the ultimate style icon in black bikini during dreamy vacation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./an-interview-with-intel-ceo-bob-swan-roundtable-qa-on-fabs-and-future.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Roundtable Q&amp;amp;A on Fabs and Future</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
