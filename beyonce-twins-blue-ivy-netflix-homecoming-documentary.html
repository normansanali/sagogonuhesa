However, based on Twitter's reaction, it appears they were not ready for the bonus look into her family's life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bey got real and opened up about her "difficult" pregnancy with twins Sir and Rumi, which had fans all up in their feelings. All three of her children, including seven-year-old Blue Ivy, made rare on-camera appearances.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In true Bey fashion, the documentary and intimate glimpse into her family's dynamics weren't the artist's only gifts to her fans. She also released a massive 40-track live-album (!!) at the same time as the documentary hit Netflix. Even crazier, Blue Ivy sang her own rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” by James Weldon Johnson, which you can stream below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Naturally, the Beyhive couldn't get enough about their shared passion for all things Bey and her precious family. Below, we rounded up the best Tweets that cover a wide range of emotions including hilarious, shocked, and motivated to achieve our goals just like Bey (as long as we don't have to give up bread).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fans were ecstatic when they realized they got both a documentary and an album to stream.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the documentary, Bey got candid and revealed she had "an extremely difficult pregnancy,” according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/parents/beyonce-on-unexpected-and-extremely-difficult-pregnancy-with-twins-homecoming/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>. “My body went through more than I knew it could.” Fans were shocked but appreciative of her openness.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Others were highly impressed with Bey's resilience and determination to put in work after giving birth to her twins.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the twins appeared on screen, the Beyhive couldn't handle how cute they were. Some even believe Rumi is the spitting image of her mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, her husband Jay-Z was also on camera and was shown spending some time with his three children and wife.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Blue Ivy speaks (and sings) you listen. She also didn't come to play with the backup dancers and followed along as they practiced their choreography.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Homecoming is available to stream on Netflix now. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81013626?source=35" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch here" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-9271a0 emevuu60">Watch here</a></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d513768d-85e7-45bd-84c7-b5cb68908a8d_1667322961.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Nicole Saunders" title="Headshot of Nicole Saunders" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><a href=#>Nicole Saunders</a>is the beauty editor at Best Products with over seven years of experience researching, writing, and editing lifestyle content.
