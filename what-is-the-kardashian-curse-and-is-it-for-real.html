Fans wonder about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe Kardashian and Tristian Thompson's relationship</a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a></strong>&nbsp;has had&nbsp;a few high-profile love stories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone will miss the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">funny lines on KUWTK</a>&nbsp;and being able to watch the famous clan on a regular basis once the reality series goes off the air. But there's something else that has gotten people talking and it's the idea that there is a "Kardashian curse." Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=the-kardashian-curse>The Kardashian Curse</h2><p>With the recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photos of Khloe and her ex together at Kim's birthday bash</a>, fans are amazed that this famous couple seems to be in love once again.</p><p>He is someone who people say has been part of the Kardashian curse, so what is it?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner brought up the idea of a Kardashian curse</a>&nbsp;back in 2016. In a&nbsp;Keeping Up With The Kardashians&nbsp;episode, she said, “The Kardashian curse is every male figure that comes and dates a Kardashian. Their life kind of just goes downhill after that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While of course, it's true that everyone has ups and downs in life, and many other celebrities have faced hard times, it does seem interesting that after athletes date and break up with Kardashians, their careers and lives seem to spiral in a negative way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kardashians Leave Caitlyn Jenner In The Dust After She Reveals Closely Guarded Secrets</a></span></p><h2 id=these-famous-athletes-have-been-cursed>These&nbsp;Famous Athletes Have Been 'Cursed'</h2><p>According to&nbsp;Hollywood Life, many famous&nbsp;athletes have been "cursed" by dating members of the Kardashian family. They have seen huge changes in their careers (and not for the better).&nbsp;Some would say that it's not a curse at all and is just the way that things go but it does seem weird that it keeps happening.</p><p>People said that the&nbsp;Cleveland Cavaliers' 2017 season wasn't going well and LeBron James thought that it might be because Khloe Kardashian was dating Tristan Thompson. As a source explained to the website, "The <span class=il>Cavs haven’t been playing up to their potential lately, and they’re coming up with every reason possible for their bad play. LeBron actually joked and talked about the Kardashian curse being real.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jalen Rose, ESPN analyst, mentioned the Kardashian Curse</a>, too. According to&nbsp;Ranker.com, when the team lost the third game of the 2017 NBA finals and the Golden State Warriors won, Rose explained,&nbsp;"I want to say what everybody’s thinking. There are three things in life that are certain to me: Father Time, gravity, and the curse of the Kardashians. Tristan Thompson had zero points in two of the three (Finals) games."</p><p>James Harden and Khloe&nbsp;were in a relationship from June 2015 to February 2016 and said the following year was the "worst."&nbsp;Cheat Sheet&nbsp;says that when he wouldn't perform well in a game during their relationship, people would post memes online and say that it was because he was dating a Kardashian.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Hollywood Life, Lamar Odom also feels he was part of this Kardashian curse. After he and Khloe got divorced, he was in a coma and according to&nbsp;TMZ.com, he had six heart attacks and twelve strokes while he was in that coma, so it was definitely a scary time. He's no longer part of the NBA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Remember when Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries got married... for 72 days? According to&nbsp;Ranker, Kris Humphries is part of the Kardashian Curse because there's quite a stigma to being married for only 72 days, especially to a Kardashian.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Media Mourns The End Of ‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’</a></span></p><h2 id=the-n-score>'The N-Score'</h2><p>When Kim Kardashian was expecting a baby in 2017, people started talking about the effect on Kayne West.&nbsp;The Huffington Post&nbsp;interviewed Stephen Master, SVP of Sports for Nielsen, who said that how popular an athlete is can be determined by an "N-Score." The publication notes that people call this the Kardashian Curse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Master explained,&nbsp;"Between Lamar Odom, Reggie Bush and Kris Humphries, those guys have all had their N-Score hurt, and it isn't because of their awareness. Their awareness has actually shot up, in every case, but their negative appeal has also shot up. You need to do well, and you also need to date someone who people like. The Kardashians are controversial." He continued that the famous family has "really negatively impacted the marketability of" these famous athletes. It's fascinating to hear this perspective that not everyone loves the Kardashians, as so many love following them on social media and watching their reality show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordyn Woods’ Fans Petition Her To Take Over From The Kardashians</a></span></p><p>Of course, curses aren't real, but it does seem like the athletes who have dated the&nbsp;Kardashians play badly in games or see a lot of&nbsp;bad things happen in their lives once their romance is done. It's definitely an interesting theory to think about.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Does Kanye West Know About The Kardashians That They Choose To Keep Private?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOhnGajkaexor%2FHopinZZOqv7SxjJqlnWWZqHqqwIyfpqtlopqurXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-eckman-net-worth-260426.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dan Eckman Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-a-bad-business-writing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is a bad business writing?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
