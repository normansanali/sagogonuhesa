Fans of The Bachelorette may know him as one of the contestants from last year’s season. The reality star, unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away at the age of 29 back in January.</a></p><p>The Medical Examiner-Office from Palm Beach County, Florida, confirmed to Page Six today that Mr. Gwozdz died from opiates, heroin specifically. The Medical Examiner’s Office ruled it as an accident. Documents obtained by the outlet additionally showed that his girlfriend admitted to her boyfriend recently taking heroin.</p><p>The associate medical examiner’s statement read that due to the information acquired from his girlfriend, and also the “lack of admissions specimens for testing his death,” they were best to classify it as “Opioid Toxicity.”</p><p>Furthermore, the statement read that it’s possible there may have been another substance other than heroin at play, however, due to the circumstances surrounding his passing, they had to rule it in the manner listed above.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/By0sNIqgK0E/</p><p>As it was previously reported, the authorities responded to a 911 call regarding an overdose at the reality star’s home on the 13th of January. Approximately one week later, reports indicated that The Bachelorette alum had died.</p><p>Released initially by The Palm Beach Post, the scary 911 call featured a woman screaming at him to wake up. The phone call also featured Tyler’s girlfriend saying she was looking to see if she could find Narcan, which is commonly used to treat opioid overdoses.</p><p>The report from the Medical Examiner’s Office stated there was a syringe and a “powdery substance” on the bathroom vanity. Reports have indicated that Gwozdz had struggled with drug addiction. Tyler left The Bachelorette suddenly and without explanation after briefly appearing on the show.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Hailing from Florida and achieving a graduate degree in psychology, Tyler left the season in 2019 after just three weeks without any explanation from anybody close to the production. Earlier this week, Harry Hains, the American Horror Story alum, also passed away from opioids, more specifically, fentanyl intoxication.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGekrrmmvoygrqiylK96s7HPqKmtnZShxm6wyJ6bZp6ipLpuu8%2BipqKcXam8ubXCoquyZWNshHp9j2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./upgrade-nightlife-itinerary-electric-zoo-official-afterparties.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Upgrade Your Nightlife Itinerary With Electric Zoos Official Afterparties</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tony-jefferson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tony Jefferson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
