If you want your partner to spend money on you, show him respect, be honouring, and treat him well.</p><li><h3>Purchase gifts for him</h3></li><p>Men can be difficult to please, but when you surprise them out of the blue, it brings out their inner tough guy, and they open their purse to give you whatever you desire. If you want a man to get you things, you need to also be a giver to him. Just randomly buy him things, take him out, and it will melt his heart, he will give you anything you need. Treat him to a meal at his favorite restaurant, and to maintain his male “dominance,” he’ll feel forced to respond to your small gift. It could be anything from a framed photograph to a painting.</p><li><h3>Prepare his favorite dish.</h3></li><p>According to a common proverb, “the road to a man’s heart is through his stomach.” If you feed your man well, he will be more eager to purchase you something. You can just pitch in and tell him what you want while he’s eating; I’m sure he won’t be able to resist you.</p><li><h3>Be direct and straight to the point.</h3></li><p>Most women are skilled at going round in circles, and most men don’t have time for it. Simply ask in a quiet and cool manner, and he won’t be able to say no once he hears your voice. Despite your best efforts at providing hints, guys sometimes have a hard time figuring out what their women desire. If he can’t read your mind, simply come out and tell him what you need him to do for you.</p><li><h3>Have Patience</h3></li><p>No matter how urgent you require that item, after you’ve asked and he tells you to relax, be patient and refrain from nagging. Men despise whiny women, and don’t be upset if he doesn’t get you everything you want. Let him know you’re aware of his situation and that you still care about him. He’ll remember and pull out his card when the time comes. If you wait for him to purchase you something special, he might surprise you with it, making the gift much more meaningful.</p><p>Whatever strategy you use to gain things from your man, be a lady with class and refrain from pestering him. Know when to inquire in the correct mood and when to remain silent. It is quite beneficial.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOq5yvnZGhsqV5w6Kdn52imru1edaasKxlpKR6qLHTZrCoraJiuqK6jK2mZqugmrulec6nZLKnpWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sondra-celli-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sondra Celli Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pregnant-kim-kardashian-baby-bump-tight-white-dress-peach-coat-2015287.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pregnant Kim Kardashian Works Bump in Tight White Dress, Heels</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
