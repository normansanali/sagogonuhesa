He was due to marry his fiancee Danielle’ Dani’ Hampson, a dancer and PR executive. The couple had postponed their wedding twice due to coronavirus restrictions and had found the perfect slot for the long-awaited nuptials.&nbsp;</p><p>Mann went from joyful expectation to unimaginable despair after Dani passed away in the early hours of their wedding day. Tom wrote on Instagram:</p><p>“I can’t believe I am writing these words. On what was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives ended in irreversible heartbreak. I feel like I have cried an ocean.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=several-unsubstantiated-rumors-have-emerged-about-danis-death></span>Several unsubstantiated rumors have emerged about Dani’s death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At the moment, Dani’s loved ones haven’t published her cause of death.</p><p>Rumors have emerged claiming that she passed away in a car accident or died due to a coronavirus vaccine complication. These reports are unproven.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=mann-vowed-to-wear-his-wedding-band-as-a-testament-to-his-love-for-dani></span>Mann vowed to wear his wedding band as a testament to his love for Dani<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tom Mann rose to fame on season 11 of the&nbsp;X Factor&nbsp;in 2014. He auditioned solo before the judges placed him in a band dubbed Stereo Kicks.&nbsp;</p><p>The band placed fifth, and shortly after the show ended, the band released its first single. However, Stereo Kicks didn’t last long after&nbsp;X Factor: the members split after a year but remained friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Mann and Hampson were initially supposed to marry in August 2020 but were forced to postpone the wedding twice due to coronavirus restrictions. The wedding would never happen, unfortunately, due to the tragic and unexpected death of the bride. Nevertheless, Mann said he would wear his wedding band as a testament to his love for Dani. He wrote:</p><p>“I know you know that you were my entire world and the best thing that has ever happened to me, Danielle. I will wear this ring that I was always supposed to wear as a sign of my unconditional love to you.”</p><p>Tom described himself as completely broken but promised to find strength for his and Dani’s baby boy, Bowie. The child arrived in October 2021. Mann continued:</p><p>“I will not be a mark on the parent that you had already become but I promise I will do my everything to raise Bowie just the way we always wanted. I promise you he will know how amazing his mummy was. I promise to make you so, so proud.”</p><p>Mann referred to Hampson as the most beautiful person inside and the most incredible person.&nbsp;“My darling Dani,”&nbsp;Tom wrote,&nbsp;“the brightest light in any room, my world is nothing but darkness without you. I will miss you forever.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=tributes-have-poured-in-from-family-and-friends></span>Tributes have poured in from family and friends<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tom wrote that he expected an ‘abundant outpouring of love,’ and he was right. Former members of Stereo Kicks and other celebrities sent their condolences under Tom’s announcement post.&nbsp;</p><p>The Spice Girls, who’d worked with Dani in 2019, wrote on Twitter:&nbsp;“We were very saddened to hear of the passing of Dani Hampson who was part of the Spiceworld 2019 family. Sending love and strength to Tom, Bowie and Dani’s family and friends.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We were very saddened to hear of the passing of Dani Hampson who was part of the Spiceworld 2019 family.

Her father, Martin, described her as the selfless ‘beating heart’ of their family. Martin continued:</p><p>“She will always be my little princess, the love of mum’s life, the sister Andy adored, Helena’s BFF, Tom’s true love, and of course, Bowie’s amazing mummy. We are all devastated and utterly heartbroken.”</p><p>Martin expressed hope in the healing power of time but stated that at the moment, the family was broken.&nbsp;“Danielle, we will love you forever. Sleep tight sweetheart, sleep tight.”</p><p>Dani’s brother Andrew referred to Dani as his best friend; he described their love as immeasurable. Andrew expressed pride in Hampson’s career achievements and stated that Dani’s greatest achievement was becoming a mother. Andrew concluded:</p><p>“The outpouring of love we have already witnessed is a testament to the wonderful person you were. I wish we could have just one last hug, drink, laugh together and I could have the opportunity to tell you, you were everything to me. I will love you forever, my beautiful sister.”</p><p>Hampson’s sister-in-law Helena described her as a selfless person who always placed other people’s needs before hers. Helen wrote:&nbsp;“I looked up to you since the moment I met you Danielle, the big sister I never had and never knew I needed, a best friend. Love you and miss you forever.”</p><p>Mann predicted that despite the outpouring of love, he would likely grieve for a long time.&nbsp;“Right now I am grieving and I will be for a very, very long time,”&nbsp;he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqltcRmm5qmmWK1ornPrKanZZSesm6ty6VkmpqfqsFutMSrZK6mla29pq%2FTnptmqJGowKq6xmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-taylor-swift-made-26-million-from-diet-coke.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Taylor Swift Made $26 Million From Diet Coke</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-farmers-alliances-change-the-way-small-farmers-operated-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How did farmers alliances change the way small farmers operated</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
