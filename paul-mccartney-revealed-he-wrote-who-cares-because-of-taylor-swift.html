"He’d send me a track; he’d make new tracks, add to the folder; I would write the entire top line for a song, and he wouldn’t know what the song would be about, what it was going to be called, where I was going to put the chorus.I had originally thought, ‘Maybe I’ll make an album in the next year, and put it out in January or something,’ but it ended up being done and we put it out in July."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "And I just thought there are no rules anymore, because I used to put all these parameters on myself, like, ‘How will this song sound in a stadium?

"My thing was similar to that: After having done this little bit of film music, I had a lot of stuff that I had been working on… and it’d be left half-finished. So I just started saying, ‘Well, what about that? I never finished that.’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "And because it didn’t have to amount to anything, I would say, ‘Ah, I really want to do tape loops. I don’t care if they fit on this song, I just want to do some.’ So I go and make some tape loops, and put them in the song, just really trying to do stuff that I fancy. … I had no idea it would end up as an album; I may have been a bit less indulgent."</p><h2 id=paul-mccartney-wrote-his-song-39-who-cares-39-about-taylor-and-her-relationship-with-her-fans>Paul McCartney Wrote His Song 'Who Cares' About Taylor And Her Relationship With Her Fans</h2><p>When McCartney released his album "Egypt Station," many of his fans were surprised to learn that one of its tracks was inspired by Swift. The song "Who Cares" is mainly inspired by Swift's personal life and her relationship with her fans.</p><p>McCartney spoke about Swift and the song's inspiration in a BBC interview.</p><p>"I was actually thinking about Taylor Swift and her relationship to her young fans and how it’s sort of a sisterly thing," McCartney said.
