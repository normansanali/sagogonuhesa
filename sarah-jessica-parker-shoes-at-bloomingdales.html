Since launching her shoe line in February 2014, the SJP brand has offered a range of chic styles in various hues at an affordable price point. Think: single sole pumps in jewel tone silks, peep toe sandals with scalloped edges and well-balanced t-strap heels in neutral colors. The signature touch? A grosgrain ribbon on the back seam of the heel, which is a nod to Parker's mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To celebrate the launch of SJP shoes at Bloomingdale's in New York City this weekend, the store hosted the actress for a meet and greet with fans that encompassed some shoe signing and some serious style. Here, we sat down with the actress to talk all things shoes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Harper's BAZAAR: </strong>Do you consider yourself a flats or heels type of woman?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Sarah Jessica Parker: </strong>I've never considered myself any particular kind of person. In my work, I'm required to wear every shoe of every width, height or shape, color, vintage decade or century. My life dictates that I'm rushing my kids to school in the streets of New York and if it's mid February, I'm a boot person. If I'm running to the market to get groceries and dinner for my family, it's likely that I'm going to be wearing something that can traverse city streets. Today, I really wanted to shine myself up and look my best. I often feel that that's more the case with a heel. I have a shoe called the 'Veronica' that's super dressy and flat. I've worn it on red carpet events all summer long. It's more about what story you're trying to tell than the height of the shoe. A lot of women can't wear high heels and they are really, really dressy in flats.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB: </strong>Do you have a memorable shoe moment in your life that stands out?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>SJP:</strong> Not really, no. I have lots of them. I've probably worn a lot more shoes than most people do in life. I've had so many different experiences with different places across the globe, wearing different shoes—old, new, off the runway—even off of somebody else's feet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB:</strong> How many shoes do you own?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>SJP:</strong> Not a lot. I'm not really a shopper. I buy vintage, but I also keep shoes a long time, which I think speaks to this collection. Everything that we produce, we aim to make it deserving of hard-earned dollars. We like to think you can look at anything in this collection and feel like it's relevant in three or four years. That's kind of the way I shop.</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB: </strong>Can you remember the first ever shoe you really coveted?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>SJP:</strong> I met George Malkemus, my current business partner, at a Manolo Blahnik trunk show in Los Angeles. It was the mid '80s. I used a credit card that I didn't have any business using to buy a bunch of shoes because I loved them so much. It wasn't a shoe that I knew at that time that I coveted or wanted, I didn't know the designer Manolo Blahnik. Most people in this country didn't know him. I couldn't afford what I bought. When I saw the shoes that were being offered at his show, I just loved them. That was my first real investment in a shoe. But I didn't know I wanted it until I saw it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB: </strong>What makes a shoe iconic?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>SJP:</strong> I don't know, I think we use the word iconic like every other friggin' word now. I think we toss it around and apply it to so many things. I think what's iconic about a shoe is it's first appearance. What was that first moment that a pump first appeared? I think there's been amazing shoe moments and a lot of them have happened over the past 10 or 15 years. The shoe market and the shoe category has become so much more a part of conversation, from things that Manolo has done over the years to things that McQueen has done on the runway, to the way they're used in theater, Chinese opera and all sorts of things.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB: </strong>Tell us about the some of the inspiration behind your own shoe line.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>SJP: </strong>Bloomingdale's is our first New York City home. We're thrilled about it, as we're basically lifelong New Yorkers. There are three really important pillars to the shoe collection. I wanted very much to revisit and recommit to the single sole. At a time when I first started having this conversation, the shoe industry was flirting with a lot of other styles. I had been a lifelong fan and devotee of the single sole. I also grew up in New York at a time where color was a huge part of the shoe business. Shoe designers like Charles Jourdan were a huge part of using color on a fairly conventional silhouette and last. My business partner George and I very much wanted to really recommit to that idea that had gone somewhat out of fashion. And finally, the grosgrain ribbon at the back was a nod to my mother. I grew up having to wear hair ribbons and grosgrain was pretty much the vast majority and ruling ribbon. When the samples came back, there was no grosgrain and it was just a regular seam. It's since become our signature characteristic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB:</strong> There were so many amazing shoe moments during Sex and The City. What's one of your favorites?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>SJP:</strong> With a character that's so fevered about something, it's hard. There were a lot. I think the one that people remember, love and talk about a lot is the moment she sees the Manolo Mary Janes in the Vogue closet and says, 'Oh my God, I thought this was an urban myth." I think that was a very funny and clever way of talking about something that is to some, a silly sort of infatuation. But it gives it some kind of smarts. That's great writing and the fact that that great shoe existed… I knew from that, because I had borrowed a pair for an event and ended up keeping them. But then, one time, I did see Manolo Mary Janes in the Vogue closet and they weren't beaten up. Mine were soaked from the rain, and I had run city blocks in those shoes. When Carrie said that line, I was like, 'I get it!'</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/b6abc375-c94a-4cdc-9891-fbdadaa6d1db_1526037769.jpg alt="Headshot of Kristen Bateman" title="Headshot of Kristen Bateman" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kristen Bateman is a contributing editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
