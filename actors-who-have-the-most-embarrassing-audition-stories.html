Who would’ve thought that even after years and hundreds of auditions, some actors who have won the most grandiose awards still experience a bad audition? It’s comforting enough to know that even the people whom we think are perfect still fall short and totally ruin their audition that could’ve been their big break like how <a href=#>Vin Diesel got his break from Fast and Furious</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the greatest performers have shared numerous tales of terrible auditions, some from their early careers and some from later in their careers when they were already the big star that they are. In most cases, nerves play a major part in these uncomfortable audition situations, demonstrating that even the most talented people are nervous performing in front of an audience. Here’s a list of the 8 actors who have some of the most embarrassing audition stories.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Tom Holland & 7 Other Actors Who Are Often Typecast Into Their Roles">Tom Holland & 7 Other Actors Who Are Often Typecast Into Their Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-holland><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tom Holland</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spider-Man star Tom Holland declared in an interview that trying out for Star Wars brought back fond memories. He seems to couldn't keep himself from giggling during his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">auditions for Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a>. In an interview, Tom confessed that while reading lines, he couldn’t contain his laughter. As humiliating as it can be, he laughed out loud and felt terribly ashamed because his co-actor was trying really hard and seriously to act the part of an android or drone. At this time, it is still by far the most humiliating audition he has ever been to.</p><h2 id=timoth-eacute-e-chalamet><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Timothée Chalamet</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is not a secret that before Tom Holland became Spider-Man, Timothée Chalamet was considered to play the role. "I read twice, and I left sweating, in a tremendous panic," Chalamet recalled.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Chalamet wants to re-do his audition</a> as he confessed to his agent at UTA for he felt like he hadn't done a good job. But his representative warned him against reapplying, and Chalamet was ultimately unsuccessful in landing the part that soon became Tom Holland’s.</p><h2 id=lucy-hale><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lucy Hale</span></h2><p>Hale revealed that when she tried out for the role of Anastasia in 50 Shades of Grey, Lucy Hale labeled herself "naive" and the part ultimately went to Dakota Johnson afterwards. After her audition, Hale told the Associated Press that she was "mortified" since she had read a "sexually forward monologue" and didn't know what she was saying.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>50 Shades of Grey was adapted from the book by E.L James where a lot of sexual stuff was included since it tackles about BDSM. Lucy Hale was too naive to play such a mature role.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Henry Cavill Just Confirmed He's Back As Superman, So Is Man Of Steel 2 Happening?">Henry Cavill Just Confirmed He's Back As Superman, So Is Man Of Steel 2 Happening?</a></span></p><h2 id=henry-cavill><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Henry Cavill</span></h2><p>It is a remarkable part of Cavill’s journey as an actor not to be chosen to play a one-of-a-kind role as James Bond. In the audition, Cavill admitted to being a little unprepared when he was asked to recreate a scene from an earlier James Bond film where he will just be wearing a towel. In an interview, Henry Cavill revealed that he was a little overweight to be playing the role. This comment became a wake-up call to Cavill and appreciated Martin Campbell’s honesty about his physique.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-stone><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Emma Stone</span></h2><p><a href=#>Emma Stone who is good friends with Jesse Eisenberg</a> revealed in a Jimmy Fallon interview that she failed her All That audition because she was unprepared, which is why she failed. She anticipated receiving drawings, but five minutes before her audition, she was informed that she needed to create three characters.</p><p>She managed to put something together– she recalled making a babysitter who is possessed and a cheerleader who couldn't spell what she was cheering for. But I guess her creativity is not enough to be cast in the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Emma Stone Completely Lost Her Cool During This Scene With Ryan Gosling">Emma Stone Completely Lost Her Cool During This Scene With Ryan Gosling</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jake-gyllenhaal><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jake Gyllenhaal</span></h2><p>In an interview with Jimmy Fallon, Jake Gyllenhaal admitted that one of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the most embarrassing auditions</a> he has ever been to was when he auditioned as Frodo in Lord of the Rings. Jake was asked to read a few lines, but little did he know, he is missing one important point while doing it.</p><p>After his reading, director Peter Jackson gave him a scathing answer since he didn't know he had to audition with an English accent. Jackson told Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal failed to get the role for his missing accent.</p><h2 id=january-jones><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>January Jones</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>January Jones tried out for a part in Coyote Ugly before Mad Men ever existed. In this audition, the <a href=#>actress who got rich from Mad Men</a> was asked to do a pole dancing routing without actually a pole involved. This was the exact moment that made January Jones realize that she didn’t want to do it anymore for how humiliating this experience was. Who wouldn’t be humiliated after such a terrible experience like this?</p><h2 id=tina-fey><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tina Fey</span></h2><p>Tina Fey was an improv performer at Chicago's legendary Second City in the '90s. Throughout those years, she often auditioned for advertisements, but she never felt at ease with the process. Particularly distressing was recalling an audition for a McDonald's advertisement. She goes through the humiliation all over again during interviews when asked about the worst audition experience she has ever been.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# title="Tina Fey Revealed Kevin Spacey Once Hit On Her During An SNL Afterparty Before Coming Out">Tina Fey Revealed Kevin Spacey Once Hit On Her During An SNL Afterparty Before Coming Out</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnKyfp8Buw8eoZKGZppp6tbTEZqSoq6Risq6uwKupmqujnruoecCum6KsmaS7br%2FTqKminaNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-playing-joker-in-the-batman-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is playing Joker in The Batman 2022?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-story-of-the-2012-lehigh-and-norfolk-state-mens-basketball.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Story of the 2012 Lehigh and Norfolk State Men's Basketball</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
