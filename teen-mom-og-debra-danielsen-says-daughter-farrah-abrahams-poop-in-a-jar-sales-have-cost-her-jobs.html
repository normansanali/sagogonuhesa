Do you think there was any time I would ever suggest she get to that level of human depravity?” Debra rhetorically asked. “Why would you sell your soul? Why would you be so depraved that you would do that?”</p><p>According to Debra, she found out about her daughter’s peculiar side hustle via her husband, Dr. David Merz, and it completely threw her off guard.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“David told me about it. I had no idea,” Debra shared. “I’m sitting there and he’s telling me this and I’m like, ‘What?!’ He came to me and told me about it, trying to protect me so that when I go into a room and someone throws this [topic] at me, I’m not blown out of the water.”</p><p>Debra showed compassion for her daughter and hinted that Farrah might be too far gone for any help from family.</p><p>“It hurts me deeply because I know my daughter deep down inside is better than that. I have no idea how to pull her back,” Debra said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Debra says Teen Mom OG alum Farrah was ‘set up,’ poop jars have cost her work</h2><p>Because she has trouble believing that Farrah would stoop to selling her poop online, Debra surmised that one of her daughter’s enemies set her up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“Somebody who is [her] enemy got on OnlyFans and said ‘I’ll give you 1000 bucks if you s**t in a vile.’ She thinks it’s a great idea and a great way to earn money, not realizing she was set up,” Debra conjectured.</p><p>“All I know is that I’m really sad and disappointed that I heard about all of this [sic], and it affects me and Sophia negatively. People come after us and say horrible things.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Debra feels that Farrah’s actions have cost her work.</p><p>“People think I’m like Farrah. No, I’m not anything like that,” Debra said. “I’ve gone to school and achieved so many things, made history, and it’s all destroyed when you have one person running around doing weird s**t.”</p><p>According to the outlet, Debra also claimed she was turned down for a reality TV show she recently pitched and believes the stigma attached to her because of Farrah’s actions is to blame.</p><p>Farrah is currently working on her mental health at a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trauma treatment center</a> where she checked herself in earlier this month.</p><p>Teen Mom OG is currently on hiatus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Sasq95zKikZqeXYrGmrtGaZJ2Znp6yrb%2FEp2SsmamoeqWt1KCfrZ2iYrOivtGan2aZkqeuqa3MrGSpp5%2Bleqq6jJpko5miYsCiuMSsZKGZppp6pLvSrWShnaJit7Cu0mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-punching-mean-in-the-uk.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Does &amp;quot;Punching&amp;quot; Mean in the U.K.?
