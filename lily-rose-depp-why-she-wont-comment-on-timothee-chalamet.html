And so that’s something that I’ve carried on into my own career and that’s really important to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lily-Rose-Depp-Wont-Comment-on-Timothee-Chalamet.jpg><p>The model is the daughter of <a href=#><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Paradis</strong></a> and began her acting career at age 15 with a cameo in the <a href=#><strong>Kevin Smith</strong></a> movie Tusk. Former Chanel creative director <a href=#>Karl Lagerfeld</a> also recruited her as an ambassador for the brand when she was 15; she’s since appeared in print ads for the iconic fashion house and served as the face of the No. 5 L’Eau fragrance.</p><p>The Crisis star added that she’s grateful for the “privilege in waking up and being able to love” her job but doesn’t want her career to interfere with her ability to have fun when the camera isn’t rolling. “It’s just about balancing that with also wanting to keep other things private and enjoy other parts of life,” she said.</p><p>One thing she’s keeping close to the vest? Her relationship with Chalamet, 25, which <a href=#>ended in April 2020</a> but may be back on. The pair were spotted hanging out in New York City earlier this month, and <a href=#>InTouch</a> reported that they were back together but trying to stay low-key.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lily-Rose-Depp-Wont-Comment-on-Timothee-Chalamet-Drew-Barrymore.jpg><p>The couple were last photographed together in September 2019, kissing on a boat in Italy. The Dune actor later admitted that <a href=#>he was embarrassed</a> when he saw that the intimate photos had gone viral.</p><p>“I went to bed that night thinking that was one of the best days of my life,” he told GQ in October 2020. “I was on this boat all day with someone I really loved, and closing my eyes, I was like, indisputably, ‘That was great.’ And then waking up to all these pictures, and feeling embarrassed, and looking like a real nob? All pale? And then people are like: ‘This is a P.R. stunt.’ A P.R. stunt? Do you think I’d want to look like that in front of all of you?!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZyuerO70p5knZ2gpXq4tNhmqqGdXay8r8CMnKampZWjwW67zWaroqWfqbWmsYycn5qkkaKytXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mackenzie-davis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mackenzie Davis - Bio, Age, In Relation, Height, Net Worth, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reality-tv-stars.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kimber Eastwood Age, Wikipedia, Parents, Net Worth, Married, Bio, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
