The mother-son duo competed on the show’s 14th season in 2009; in a 2010 “Deaf Person of the Year” profile from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DeafPeople.com</a>, Luke and his mother reportedly auditioned once before their season and were initially rejected as contestants. When they tried a second time, they were successful and joined the show.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>When the show began, other contestants underestimated the pair but Luke and Margie proved themselves as competitors to watch when they won the first leg. Margie was in incredible physical shape while Luke’s analytical mind helped the team make it all the way to the finals. The two would likely have won their season if not for a roadblock Luke struggled with during the final leg. Instead, the mother-son duo finished in a respectable third place.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Despite finishing in third, Luke and Margie didn’t end their race that season. The two would return to The Amazing Race for two more seasons, competing in both Unfinished Business and All-Stars. Unfortunately, the results were more or less the same for the pair; they’d start the season strong and then a roadblock would prove insurmountable. Luke and Margie finished in eighth place in those seasons.</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=58 data-injectable=false>You can watch The Amazing Race 35 at 9:30pm ET/PT on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrpqrXam1pnnFoqmsrF2ZsqKyjJympqiVqba1u9FmpqdlpJ2ybq3MmrGippdiv6KvxGaYp5xdnby4ecWaqWacmZl6tbTEsmSgp18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-bryan-sister-mackenzie-bryan-brother-and-parents-ethnicity-678640-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zach Bryan Sister Mackenzie Bryan Brother And Parents, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-claire-coffee-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Claire Coffee Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
