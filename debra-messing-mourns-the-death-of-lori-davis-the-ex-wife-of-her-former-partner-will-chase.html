No doubt, heaven has a new bright light,” <strong>Debra</strong> wrote on Instagram. “It’s not fair. You’re so good. So loving, funny, nurturing, loyal, open, optimistic, and ready to celebrate… anything.”</p><p>“Ours was a unique bond. <strong>Lori</strong> was my ex-partner’s ex-wife. Yes, that’s right. And the mother to 2 spectacular girls who I had the opportunity to fall in love with, and who became the sisters my boy never had,” she continued.</p><p><strong class=hidearticle>Click inside to check out the rest of Debra Messing’s tribute for Lori…</strong> <span id=more-1794984></span></p><p><strong>Debra</strong> wrote, “We loved each other’s children and in turn developed a beautiful friendship. We came to every school musical in Princeton, every Kidz Theatre production, we went to Broadway musicals together and she took them to Six Flags. It was special because it was entirely chosen.</p><p><strong>Debra</strong> opened up about reconnecting with <strong>Lori</strong> recently.</p><p>“We connected recently. She wrote a personal recommendation for my boy’s application to her college alma mater. I wrote letters for both of the girls’ as well. We rooted for each other. We sent singing happy birthday videos to each other, and she helped me celebrate my 50th birthday. We were chosen family,” she said. “Many many hearts are shattered right now. Please say a prayer for her family. And remember, we are guaranteed nothing. ?.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJWXv6J5zJ6qrKGenHquu9SrpaxlpJ2ybrDEmquhZZ%2Bbeq270aJknZmmnsBuwMeeZJ6wXay2p7GMqJ1moJWneqe70aacq2Wglr%2B1usSrZLChnKF6pLTArJxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erik-hayser.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erik Hayser - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-tyler-crispen-and-angela-rummans-from-big-brother-20-still-together.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Tyler Crispen and Angela Rummans from Big Brother 20 still together?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
