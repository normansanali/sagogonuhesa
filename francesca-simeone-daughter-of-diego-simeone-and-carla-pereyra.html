She was conceived by Carla and Diego Pereyra. The youngest of several siblings, Francesca.</span></h3><p>Diego goes by the nickname El Cholo, but his real name is Diego Pablo Simeone Gonzalez. Since 2011, he has served as Atletico Madrid’s manager. He holds Argentine citizenship and was born in Buenos Aires.</p><h2><span id=Gross_Value>Gross Value</span></h2><p>Since Francesca is still a minor, her income cannot be verified. Instead, we shall rely on her father, who is currently thought to have a net worth of $130 million as of January 2023. He is frequently recognized as the all-time highest-paid coach.</p><h2><span id=Discover_Francesca8217s_parents>Discover Francesca’s parents</span></h2><p>The woman, starting with her mother Carla, is renowned as a model and TV show host. Carla is an Argentine native. Carla began modeling when she was 17 years old. She moved to Milan, Italy, as a result, to pursue her goals. Prior employers include Max Mara and Alberta Ferretti.</p><p>She did, however, have a big break in 2010 when she participated in Supervivientes: Perdidos in Honduras. She has acted in the motion pictures Viva la Vida, 90 Minuti, and Amigas y conocidas. Diego, Francesca’s father, was a midfielder in contrast.</p><p>He began his club career in Argentina in the year 1987. Later, he played for clubs in Spain and Italy including Velez Sarsfield, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, Pisa Sevilla, Lazio, and Racing Club.</p><p>In 1996, Diego also won the UEFA Cup with Inter Milan and the domestic double with Atletico Madrid. At addition, he has competed for his country in the FIFA World Cups in 1994, 1998, and 2002.</p><p>She has one blood relative, at least. Valentina was born at the Monteprincipe hospital in Madrid at 10:30 a.m. In a hospital gown, helmet, and face mask, Diego published an Instagram snapshot of himself cradling his baby daughter.</p><p>“Welcome, Valentina,” he wrote as the photo’s caption. Valentine is two years younger than Francesca and is said to have weighed more than 6 pounds when he was born. Giovanni, Gianluca, and Giuliano Simeone are her half-siblings.</p><p>In truth, her parents had a clandestine wedding in Buenos Aires. Both parties kept this a secret until after the nuptials, when they posted about it online.</p><p>They wrote in the caption of the picture that they were thrilled to have married civilly on June 14 in a little ceremony in front of their family.<br>Diego is Carla’s first husband, and Carla is his second.</p><h2><span id=thinking_back_to_Diego_Simeone8217s_childhood>thinking back to Diego Simeone’s childhood</span></h2><p>Diego was born to Don Carlos Alberto Simeone and Maria Pablo Simeone. He was raised in Buenos Aires’s Palermo neighborhood. When he was younger, he used to play street soccer.</p><p>His father was an amateur player who later transitioned into sales, while his mother worked as a hairdresser. Diego had said that his parents’ consistent schedule was the reason he had been so tenacious.</p><p>He used to have his father train him, which is regarded as a talent in athletics. Diego, though, has always paid attention to and valued his father’s advice. Her sister, football agent Natalia Simeone, is actively managing Diego’s coaching career.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Sukhumala Marasri</a></h3>Sukhumala Marasri estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
