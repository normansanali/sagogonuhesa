Grimes covered the April issue of VF and described her relationship with her “boyfriend” Elon Musk, saying that they lived separately and he wasn’t financially supporting her or their two children. The VF piece was also where Grimes “accidentally” revealed the existence of their second child, Exa, who was born via surrogacy in late 2021. By the time the VF issue came out, Grimes and Elon Musk were over. We now know that when their surrogate was nearing her due date, Musk welcomed twins with one of his executives too.</p><p>Shortly after the VF interview came out, Grimes was in the gossip news for another reason: she moved on quickly from Musk and <a href=#>had begun dating Chelsea Manning</a>. They were living together in Austin, Texas almost as soon as they met. Well, now they’re over.</p><p>That was fast! Singer Grimes and whistle-blower Chelsea Manning, who just started dating in March, have broken up, a source tells Page Six. Another source tells us the pair “had been breaking up for a while.”</p><p>Page Six first exclusively revealed the duo were an item in March. The pair linked up after Grimes, 34, had split from the father of her two children, Elon Musk, for the second time. A source told us at the time that Grimes and Manning were “getting serious. They U-Hauled it. They’ve been living together in Austin.”</p><p>We were told that Manning, 34, had also kept her apartment in Brooklyn.</p><p>The same month it had been revealed in a Vanity Fair story that Grimes, real name Claire Boucher, had welcomed a second child via surrogate with Musk. She told the reporter she would “probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid. We live in separate houses. We’re best friends.” By the time the piece had printed though, they’d split.</p><p>We hear the “Oblivion,” singer is currently back on the dating scene.</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>Can these people stop being so chaotic for six solid months? My God. For all of Grimes’s anti-capitalist fairycore, she ended up having two children with <a href=#>a white supremacist Republican</a>, then did a four-month live-in relationship with a convicted felon who had her sentence commuted by President Obama. And Grimes has two small children for whom she is the sole provider. Just… buy a house, get a mattress, sue Elon for child support and settle down. Update: I mean, it’s a statement of fact, Manning is a convicted felon.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/grimes-babyx12.jpg alt width=490 sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/COSTUMEINSTITUTE_ZB4486_316339_0124.jpg alt width=490 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Backgrid, Avalon Red, Instagram.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcG9lZoJ5e8aroKado5SwqbHLrJyal52Wu6%2B1zaCWm6qfoLKgwc%2BYqaitl525uqvFqKyrl52ku7W00piYn6yVp6y1tMSylqanppqxoLXNaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./game-of-thrones-cast-celebrated-emilia-clarke-30th-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How the Game of Thrones Cast Celebrated Emilia Clarke's 30th Birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./francesca-simeone-daughter-of-diego-simeone-and-carla-pereyra.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Francesca Simeone- Daughter Of Diego Simeone And Carla Pereyra</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
