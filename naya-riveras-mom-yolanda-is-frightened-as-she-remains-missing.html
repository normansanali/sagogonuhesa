Authorities searched for her until a lack of visibility forced them to cease, but the efforts continued Thursday morning.</p><p>Officials confirmed on Thursday that the <a href=#>search is now considered a recovery mission</a>. “Multiple teams of professional search & rescue personnel are actively searching Lake Piru for clues to the location of Naya Rivera,” the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office explained on Twitter. “With over 80 people involved in the search right now, we are using helicopters, boats, ATV vehicles, and ground personnel to try and locate her.”</p><p>Josey was discovered asleep on the boat, which Naya rented earlier on Wednesday, and was wearing a life vest. “Another vest [was found] on board the boat for an adult, so it looks like [Naya] was not wearing [hers],” Captain Eric Buschow of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;on Wednesday. “The son said they were in the water swimming together. He came up and got back up on the boat, but she did not. He was found on the boat by a passerby.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Buschow shared an update on Josey’s condition on Thursday, telling reporters that <a href=#>he is “in good health”</a> after the incident. “The family is going through a very traumatic time right now,” he noted. Family members picked up the child on Wednesday evening.</p><p>Six days before she went missing, <a href=#>Naya tweeted about living with purpose</a>. “No matter the year, circumstance, or strifes [every day] you’re alive is a blessing,” she wrote on July 2. “Make the most of today and every day you are given. Tomorrow is not promised.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Glee</a>&nbsp;alum <a href=#>shares Josey with ex-husband</a> <a href=#><strong>Ryan Dorsey</strong></a>. The pair <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanmamWerO11Z6pmqtdoryuedioo5qmlJZ6qr%2BMn6min5ipsq%2Bxw2aYrGWjnbJuvsSmmKKmo2K6qr%2FSoqWgZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oscar-hosts-best-and-worst-moments-ever-85-years-of-laughs-and-gaffes-2013192.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oscar Hosts' Best and Worst Moments Ever: Laughs and Gaffes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./move-over-mario-luigi-and-legend-of-zelda-movie-rumors-are-ramping-up.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Move over Mario, Luigi and The Legend of Zelda movie rumors are ramping up</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
