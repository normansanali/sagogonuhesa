Could you please provide additional information.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>All that was way before I started watching this show. I watched for a couple of years in the mid-1980s and I know the name Luke and that he was with Laura but I don’t remember any storylines. The other names you mentioned are unknown to me. As is the whole story that you mentioned.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Lucky AKA Lucas Lorenzon Spencer, Jr, is Laura’s son to Luke Spencer. Lucky was married to Elizabeth and is the father of her youngest son, Aiden. The Balkin was actually Theo (not sure of his last name) an attorney who worked with Diane Miller. His son dated Brenda Barrett. Brenda was one of Sonny’s and Jax’ s many girlfriends. I am not sure if Brenda married his son, but she had a child with him. Brenda was a friend of Robin Scorpio and Ned’s wife Lois. Siobhan worked at Jake’s bar as a waitress. She was murdered by Anthony Zaharia (SP). Someone had mentioned in another post about Lucky leaving town. I am sorry if my posting about past events upset you.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>That is ok. I read someone’s post about Lucky leaving town because of Elizabeth. I am sorry, I don’t remember who posted it, or what the title of the thread was. I thought Lucky left town to bury his wife in Ireland where she grew up. While he was in Ireland, Lucky started having dark thoughts and feelings just like his father, Luke. That is one reason he has not returned to PC. I am sorry if posting about events from the past upsets you.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>It doesn’t upset me. In fact I like reading bits and pieces about what’s happened in the past because I only know stuff from April this year.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png title=:slightly_smiling_face: alt=:slightly_smiling_face: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Lots of old episodes are on youtube</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I miss Lucky so much. I remember when Liz first came back to town and she was about 15 and she smoked and got in a lot of trouble. She had a crush on Lucky, but he liked her sister, Sara.<br>Then Liz got raped in the park and Lucky found her. He was so tender with her, and took her to his house. Then he called his Aunt Bobbie, (who of course is a nurse), and she came over and took care of Liz. Liz went from rebellious to a timid recluse. But Lucky supported her, and they fell in love and got married.</p><p>Just another FYI, years, and years later, Lucky found out about Luke raping Laura and he had an especially hard time dealing with it because of what he saw Elizabeth go through.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>You can also find old episodes on Dailymotion.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Ok. Thanks for telling me. Recently, I bought 2 books from a bargain bin at Walmart. I checked which one would have been first. I enjoyed them so much, I checked for other books. Those two were 14 and 15 in a series of 18. I thought I have to read more about these characters. I ordered a set of the first 5.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I don’t want to watch a bunch of old episodes. I’m just happy to hear little bits and pieces every now and then.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>I understand that it is very time consuming. I just go to Soaps Central and click on General Hospital, then search and type in the name of the character and a lot of information comes up. I had rechecked it to learn more about Lucky leaving town. It has been a while since I watched some of the old episodes of performances from the Nurses Ball. I like the karaoke night’s at Jake’s when Coleman was the bartender. Diane Miller sang, Robin and Patrick Mac and I believe Spinelli.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Ty. I really enjoy seeing the old episodes and getting the backstory</p><p>I miss Lucky, it would be nice to bring him back in some capacity, especially If Chase is out of the cop business, or if Mac retires “again” or hopefully if Jordan leaves!</p><p>Dante needs a partner!</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Did you watch GH when Dante came to town undercover? He got a job working for Sonny. Lulu and Dante started dating. Lucky got fed up with them, he called Ethan, and they got in a fight with Dante. My memory is fuzzy on the details, but I think Dante did not fight back. He might have had too much to drink.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Yes i remember that but it was also nearly 15 years ago, and Dante married Lulu so I’m sure all is behind the two, they would likely actually enjoy each other now, Lucky was a hot headed cop at one point as well</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Luke and Laura were a supercouple from the 80’s. Somehow they fell in love with each other after Luke raped Laura. Luke is Bobbie Spencers (Carly’s mom) brother. Anyway, Lucky is their first born. He came really onto the scene in the mid 90’s played by an amazing teen actor, Jonathan Jackson. A few years after he arrived as a teen, Elizabeth came to live with her gran Audrey Hardy who was on the show for a long time. Liz and Lucky fell in love after Liz was raped (the writing back then was spot on, they did a great job with these scenes and they were written so delicately. The writers really did care about quality). Anyway, about a year after they started dating, Lucky was kidnapped and I believe it was Helena Cassadine and Caesar Faison who made it seem like Lucky died in a fire. It was gutwrenching. I mean they spent time on the grief. I cried and cried.</p><p>Lucky returned several years later (after Liz and Jason had sort of started falling in love) but was played by a different actor and it just wasn’t the same for me.</p><p>There are some old Liz and Lucky scenes like from 98 and 99 on youtube. Jonathan won several emmys for his work as Lucky. He was brilliant. I never liked another Lucky and stopped watching the show for along time after that.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I remember Gregg Vaughn as Lucky. He was Lucky when he dated Sam, and before Sam, he was involved with Maxie (I think he was the actor then). I remember Maxie pretending to be pregnant, and getting drugs from the hospital for him, but I don’t remember if they dated, or if it was more like Maxie trying to get him to date her. I vaguely remember another actor playing Lucky, but I am not sure of his name. For some reason, I think his name was Jacob Young, not sure though. I think, even though Laura had to marry Scotty, because she wanted to, she was not happy with him. Luke offered excitement and danger. For a long time, Luke did not realize that his first time with Laura at the Campus Disco was rape. He thought she wanted him as much as he wanted her. Finally, Laura told Luke he had raped her. Laura started working at the Campus Disco to buy law books for Scotty as a present.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I want to say Jacob Young was the one from AMC as well? Wasn’t he lucky during the Port Charles Hotel Fire</p><p>I liked Greg Vaughn in the role, he was the “edgy” lucky especially with the drug storyline.</p><p>THe best will always be Jonathan Jackson though, raised the character, was there for 90% the pivotal lucky stories, etc!</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>KAC</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 17, 2022, 1:35pm <span itemprop=position>20</span></span><p>Those were the good ole writing days</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvLrpqksV2ovaa6wp6prGWVrba1ecWrpqZll518eXyPcmts</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-pancer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Pancer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elvita-adams.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Elvita Adams Survived A Jump Off The Empire State Building</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
