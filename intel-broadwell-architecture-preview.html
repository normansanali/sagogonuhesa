As this is a preview Intel isn’t telling us a great deal about the CPU at this time, but they have given us limited information about Broadwell’s architectural changes and what to expect for performance as a result.</p><p>With Broadwell Intel is at the beginning of the next cycle of their tick-tock cadence. Whereas tock products such as Haswell and Sandy Bridge designed to be the second generation of products to use a process node and as a result are focused on architectural changes, tick products such as Ivy Bridge and now Broadwell are the first generation of products on a new process node and derive much (but not all) of their advantage from manufacturing process improvements. Over the years Intel has wavered on just what a tick should contain – it’s always more than simply porting an architecture to a new process node – but at the end of the day Broadwell is clearly derived from Haswell and will be taking limited liberties in improving CPU performance as a result.</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=1><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=6>Intel's Tick-Tock Cadence</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td width=120>Microarchitecture</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Process Node</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Tick or Tock</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Release Year</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Conroe/Merom</td><td align=center valign=middle>65nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tock</td><td align=center valign=middle>2006</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Penryn</td><td align=center valign=middle>45nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tick</td><td align=center valign=middle>2007</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Nehalem</td><td align=center valign=middle>45nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tock</td><td align=center valign=middle>2008</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Westmere</td><td align=center valign=middle>32nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tick</td><td align=center valign=middle>2010</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Sandy Bridge</td><td align=center valign=middle>32nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tock</td><td align=center valign=middle>2011</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Ivy Bridge</td><td align=center valign=middle>22nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tick</td><td align=center valign=middle>2012</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Haswell</td><td align=center valign=middle>22nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tock</td><td align=center valign=middle>2013</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Broadwell</td><td align=center valign=middle>14nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tick</td><td align=center valign=middle>2014</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Skylake</td><td align=center valign=middle>14nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Tock</td><td align=center valign=middle>2015</td></tr></tbody></table><p>All told, Intel is shooting for a better than 5% IPC improvement over Haswell. This is similar to Ivy Bridge (4%-6%), though at this stage in the game Intel is not talking about expected clockspeeds or the resulting overall performance improvement. Intel has made it clear that they don’t regress on clockspeeds, but beyond that we’ll have to wait for further product details later this year to see how clockspeeds will compare.</p><p>To accomplish this IPC increase Intel will be relying on a number of architectural tweaks in Broadwell. Chief among these are bigger schedulers and buffers in order to better feed the CPU cores themselves. Broadwell’s out-of-order scheduling window for example is being increased to allow for more instructions to be reordered, thereby improving IPC. Meanwhile the L2 translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is being increased from 1K to 1.5K entries to reduce address translation misses.</p><p>The TLBs are also receiving some broader feature enhancements that should again improve performance. A second miss handler is being added for TLB pages, allowing Broadwell to utilize both handlers at once to walk memory pages in parallel. Otherwise the inclusion of a 1GB page mode should pay off particularly well for servers, granting Broadwell the ability to handle these very large pages on top of its existing 2MB and 4K pages.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8355/BroadwellCPU_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Meanwhile, as is often the case Intel is once again iterating on their branch predictor to cut down on missed branches and unnecessary memory operations. Broadwell’s branch predictor will see its address prediction improved for both branches and returns, allowing for more accurate speculation of impending branching operations.</p><p>Of course efficiency increases can only take you so far, so along with the above changes Intel is also making some more fundamental improvements to Broadwell’s math performance. Both multiplication and division are receiving a performance boost thanks to performance improvements in their respective hardware. Floating point multiplication is seeing a sizable reduction in instruction latency from 5 cycles to 3 cycles, and meanwhile division performance is being improved by the use of an even larger Radix-1024 (10bit) divider. Even vector operations will see some improvements here, with Broadwell implementing a faster version of the vector Gather instruction.</p><p>Finally, while it’s not clear whether these will be part of AES-NI or another instruction subset entirely, Intel is once again targeting cryptography for further improvements. To that end Broadwell will bring with it improvements to multiple cryptography instructions.</p><p>Meanwhile it’s interesting to note that in keeping with Intel’s power goals for Broadwell, throughout all of this Intel put strict power efficiency requirements in place for any architecture changes. Whereas Haswell was roughly a 1:1 ratio of performance to power – a 1% increase in performance could cost no more than a 1% increase in power consumption – Broadwell’s architecture improvements were required to be at 2:1. While a 2:1 mandate is not new – Intel had one in place for <a href=#>Nehalem</a> too – at the point even on the best of days meaningful IPC improvements are hard to come by at 1:1, never mind 2:1. The end result no doubt limited what performance optimizations Intel could integrate into Broadwell’s design, but it also functionally reduces power requirements for any given performance level, furthering Intel’s goals in getting Core performance in a mobile device. In the case of Broadwell this means Broadwell’s roughly 5% performance improvement comes at a cost of just a 2.5% increase in immediate power consumption.</p><p>With that said, Intel has also continued to make further power optimizations to the entire Broadwell architecture, many of which will be applicable not just to Core M but to all future Broadwell products. Broadwell will see further power gating improvements to better shut off parts of the CPU that are not in use, and more generalized design optimizations have been made to reduce power consumption of various blocks as is appropriate. These optimizations coupled with power efficiency gains from the 14nm process are a big part of the driving force in improving Intel’s power efficiency for Core M.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV0gZRooKeslaF6o77OmpuwnZyheqK%2BwqGgrZ2TqcKzsYypqZ6umZrEcH4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./235789-brock-lesnar-arrives-in-japan-with-former-wwe-star.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brock Lesnar Arrives In Japan; With Former WWE Star</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gma-3-host-tj-holmes-cheated-with-several-women-at-abc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'GMA3' anchor TJ Holmes cheated with several women at ABC prior to affair with Amy Robach, say</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
