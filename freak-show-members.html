Right: Earle with an average-sized man.</span></p><p>Born in 1906, Jack Earle stood six feet tall before the age of 10. And by the age of 13, he was already over seven feet tall. His true height as an adult remains debatable, but numbers have ranged from 7’7″ to 8’6″.</p><p>The reason why he was so shockingly tall was that he had a condition known as acromegalic gigantism. And while his height could be advantageous for him in some situations, it was downright dangerous in others.</p><p>Earle had been a Hollywood actor (appearing in films like Hansel and Gretel and Jack and the Beanstalk) before a fall from scaffolding <a href=# rel=noopener>led to major injuries</a>, causing his retirement from the movie industry.</p><p>Soon after his accident, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus freak show came through town with Jim Tarver as their current traveling “giant.” Earle was considerably taller than Tarver, and Ringling Bros., seeing an opportunity, offered Earle a one-year contract with the circus.</p><p>Years before, Earle had said that he never wanted to be in a freak show. But he needed to make a living, so he decided to sign the contract.</p><p>Earle was initially apprehensive. But on his first day, he was put at ease when a performer with dwarfism named Harry Doll explained that there were more “freaks” in the audience than there were in the sideshow.</p><p>The gentle giant began his Ringling Bros. career alongside 2’2″ tall Major Mite (Clarence Chesterfield Howerton). He would spend the next 14 years on the road with the sideshow — often posing alongside extremely short men or average-sized men to further emphasize his height.</p><p>After retiring, Earle went on to become a traveling salesman for the Roma Wine Company. He died of kidney failure in 1952 at the age of 46.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynvsSaomarmKTEbrnEppmeqqNkfw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-sandler-summer-trend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Sandler Summer Has Replaced the Hot Girl Summer Fashion Trend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./7-little-johnstons-jonah-is-doing-well-after-health-scare-with-wisdom-teeth-surgery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>7 Little Johnstons Jonah is doing well after health scare with wisdom teeth surgery Thu 21 A</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
