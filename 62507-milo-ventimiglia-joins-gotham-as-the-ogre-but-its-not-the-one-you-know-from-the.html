(Okay, okay — that was sarcasm.) But that doesn't mean I'm not genuinely interested in this new kid on the block, mainly because it's played by one of my very favorite actors from<i> Gilmore Girls</i>, Milo Ventimiglia. Ventimiglia's character seems almost as intriguing as Jess, though for vastly different reasons: According to Deadline, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Milo Ventimiglia has just been cast on <i>Gotham</i> </a>as "the Ogre." But, while you comic book fans may think you know exactly who the Ogre is, think again: According to the press release, this is an original character that has nothing to do with the Ogre found in the DC Comics universe.</p><p>So who is this <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ogre we're going to meet on <i>Gotham</i> </a>? His name is really Jason Lennon, and much like Bruce Wayne will grow to be, he's a wealthy playboy — except you really, really don't want to mess with this guy. According to the report, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ogre is a serial killer preying on the young women of Gotham</a> who has a truly <i>terrible </i>dating strategy. According to Deadline, the Ogre lures women into a trap and "tests" them in order to find his "perfect mate." When the ladies fail to meet his expectations, he gives them the boot... by killing them. Really makes your last Tinder date look like <i>The Notebook</i>, doesn't it?</p><p>It's not unusual for <i>Gotham</i> to create a brand-new character for the series — after all, main villainess Fish Mooney is entirely the creation of the Fox show — but it is a little different for them to choose a name associated with an actual DC Comics character.</p><p>After all, the DC Ogre is an entirely different character — in the comics, he's a genetically-altered man who bears a strong similarity to Frankenstein's monster. In <i>Batman</i> #535, the Ogre murders the scientists who created him for a government experiment and left him to die, so I guess the characters aren't wholly different — both are super into murdering people, after all.</p><p>That being said, I'm optimistic about this character, even if he sounds like he'd fit in better on <i>Criminal Minds </i>than on<i> Gotham. </i>Ultimately, I'm just thrilled to have Ventimiglia back on TV — because once Team Jess, <i>always </i>Team Jess.</p><p><i>Image: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a></i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx3fpRpbmalmaG8bsLEp6uipZmcuaqtjKOmoqajYrSwwMeapGaZo2LBqbGMqJ6rnV2XwrV5yK2qZqafqXq1tMRmpqedXa68tnnKp6awZZanvK5506Gc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./quinton-anderson-reynolds.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Quinton Anderson Reynolds</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-keenan-net-worth-63626.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Keenan Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
