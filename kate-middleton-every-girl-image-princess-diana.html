With huge, established labels like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Alexander McQueen</a> rubbing shoulders with more fashion-insider brands such as Alessandra Rich and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener>Emilia Wickstead</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Kate</a> has refined her tastes to give fans exactly what they want: a refined elegance that's fitting for the future queen consort of England. But a royal expert explains that Kate's fashion choices have been very deliberate from the very beginning and part of why she never went out wearing head-to-toe designer was because she (and the royals, no doubt) wanted her to embrace the fact that she was just a normal girl.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo by Visionhaus/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another layer of the quiet and approachable looks (remember when she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>wore Zara</a>?) was so that she could remind people of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Princess Diana</a>, the expert noted, who was also known for being relatable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So, Kate was a commoner. Especially in the British collective thinking, it was really important she did not overstep," royal reporter Elizabeth Holmes explained on the Royally Us podcast, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Daily Star</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to explain that because Kate had been in the public eye for so long, people had grown accustomed to seeing her dressed down, much like everyone remembered seeing Princess Diana in her gym clothes or out wearing everyday items as she lived her life post-divorce. While Kate may not have been copying Diana's casual outfits exactly, she did offer up the same vibes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If she would have gone out wearing designer head to toe, bespoke from the start, it would have sent a message," Holmes added. "But instead, you just sort of kept going with what she was doing. There are a lot of pictures of Kate and William in their dating years, they dated for a very long time, the public was very familiar with her by the time they announced their engagement, and she stayed true to that. And I think that lent a sort of authenticity to her. I think there was certainly a group of people who thought she should up her game a little bit more and she did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the monarchy as a whole seems to have gotten exactly what it wanted with Kate: a duchess that has perfected the balance of being approachable and aspirational.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was important for her to hold onto this every girl image and I think it was important for the monarchy as a whole," Holmes finished. "Because Diana had been the people's princess, here was one of our people joining those ranks, and there is real power in us as viewers seeing somebody we can relate to."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qaq55lnZ6xpbjEraanZ5uWwaZ5zKKbnaSVqbyvecSvnKuxXZy2s7iMoqSan5VivbO1zZycrKtdmbaiusA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lemon-detox-diet-plan-rejuvenate-body-mind.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lemon Detox Diet Plan Rejuvenate Your Body and Mind</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./juli-n-figueroa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julin Figueroa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
