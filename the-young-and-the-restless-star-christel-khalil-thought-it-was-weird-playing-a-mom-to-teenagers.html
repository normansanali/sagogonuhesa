In 2002, Khalil stepped into the role of teen Lily who has now matured into a successful businesswoman.</p><p>Aside from being a high-powered executive, Lily is also the mother of twins Charlie and Mattie Ashby (Noah Alexander Gerry and Lexi Stevenson). In 2017, the twins changed drastically when they were rapidly aged into teenagers. The producer’s decision to age Charlie and Mattie was odd, and Khalil felt the choice was weird.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TVInsider</a>, the actor discussed playing a mom to teenagers. “I was very shocked. It was very surprising for me. It was weird. The kids were as tall – actually, taller than I am. I wore heels so that Lily was taller than Mattie. They were 18 or 19 in real life, and I was 30. It was a little strange but you gotta do what you gotta do.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>‘The Young and the Restless’: Is Christel Khalil Returning to the Show on a Full-Time Basis?</a></strong></p><h2 id=h-christel-khalil-recently-celebrated-her-20th-anniversary-with-the-show>Christel Khalil recently celebrated her 20th anniversary with the show</h2><p>2022 has been the year of milestone celebrations for The Young and the Restless.
