He has never had to be in a situation in which he cannot somehow turn that loss into a win.’</p><p>Rather than admitting defeat, the ‘Too Much and Never Enough’ author insisted that the Donald will be taking a ‘wrecking ball’ to the government in the following 48 days he has left at the White House.</p><p>‘He cannot admit it to himself [he lost] because it would suggest that there is no way for him to just get out of this mess. So he is going to continue to undermine people’s trust in our government and in our institutions. It is just another 48 days that he has to keep taking a wrecking ball to the United States government.’</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“It is impossible for Donald to believe that he lost.”</p><p>Pres.

He is behaving like an immature bully. The only thing that he has left is his grievance. It isn’t going to change anything for his ardent supporters. But I think it is going to do two things: increase his irrelevance after the inauguration, and it increases the urgency of holding him accountable when he no longer has the protection of the Oval Office,’ Mary stated.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUpLuiuMNmq6utnaXAbrrInpqeZZ2Wv7p506uspqhdmbymv82tZK2gmaO4brTEpaNmm5%2BjsKawxGabnqyRnrm0eZNvZ3JwaGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-jared-s-gilmore-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Jared S.
