Purely out of curiosity, I believe — not bullying or being malicious — just curious. It stuck with him enough to tell me on the sideline though. I told him, ‘That’s how God made you, now show them how fast you are!’ He then proceeded to score a goal, and I can’t tell you how stoked we were.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “He’s starting to notice that he’s different and that’s hard to cope with — however, I WANT him to know he’s different. But maybe not in the way he thinks he is.”</p><p class=p1>The<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Little People, Big World&nbsp;</i></a>stars, <a href=#>who wed in 2015</a>, are the proud parents to <a href=#>Jackson, 5, Lilah, 3,</a> and <a href=#>Josiah</a>, 11 months. All three little ones — similarly to Zach, 32, and his parents, <a href=#><strong>Matt Roloff</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Amy Roloff</strong> </a>— have been <a href=#>diagnosed with achondroplasia</a>, which is a form of short-limb dwarfism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/roloff-jpeg.jpg><p class=p1>“Jackson, I pray that you notice that you are different. That God has set you apart from all other people,” Tori continued in her Wednesday post, penning a message to her firstborn. “I <a href=#>pray you’re different in how you see and love others</a>. I pray that you’re different in the choices you make to keep God close to your heart. I pray you’re different in how you solve problems and arguments. I pray that you think differently about how the world works and adaptations that can be made.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “I pray you see your differences and use them to change the world. You are different, kid. Different than any kid I’ve ever met. You are one of a kind and I am so stinking proud to be your mom. I love this kid so much, and pretty stoked my pep talk got him his first soccer goal!”</p><p class=p1>Zach and Tori, <a href=#>who welcomed baby No. 3 in April 2022</a>, previously opened up to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>about teaching Jackson about his physical differences.</p><p class=p1>“I was watching dwarf soccer — a bunch of dwarfs play in a game on YouTube — and [Jackson] goes, ‘Why are those players so short?” Zach<a href=#> exclusively recalled to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in May 2022</a>, noting his son doesn’t always realize his diagnosis. “And he was looking at some fans with the coaching staff. He’s like, ‘Those players are tall, you know?’ And I was like, well, those players have dwarfism. They’re like you and I.’”</p><p class=p1>Jackson previously <a href=#>underwent a surgical procedure in November 2021</a> to correct the bowing in his legs, which was a result of his achondroplasia.</p><p class=p1>“He is doing great. Everything’s great,” <a href=#>the TLC dad</a> told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in May 2022, explaining that screws were put into Jackson’s legs “so as he grows, the legs will straighten.” Zach added: “It’s not an overnight fix if you will.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While the pair’s three children all have dwarfism, Zach and Tori have made it clear that their diagnoses are not their entire identities.</p><p class=p1>“Just like I’m Tori, I have brown hair,” <a href=#>the photographer told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that May</a>. “I’m not a brunette — like, that’s not how I would classify myself. … [Achondroplasia is] so normal to us. We have so many resources and there’s a lot of parents out there who don’t have the same resources and … don’t have the same confidence in everything that Zach and I do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatp6KeerO7y6idn2Wgp66qv8SsZKynnmK3oq%2FKrKanZZGoeqmxjKyrmqqkqHq1u4ynpq2hk5p6pcPAq52iq51k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-isaiah-thomas-deserves-to-start-in-the-nba-in-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Isaiah Thomas deserves to start in the NBA in 2024?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./terry-maple-obituary-atlanta-ga-former-zoo-atlanta-director-has-died.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Terry Maple Obituary Atlanta GA, Former Zoo Atlanta Director Has Died</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
