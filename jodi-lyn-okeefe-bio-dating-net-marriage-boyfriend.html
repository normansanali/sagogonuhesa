beauty captivates the eyes and hearts of her fans.&nbsp;Best known for her role as Gretchen Morgan on the television series&nbsp;</span><span>Prison Break,</span><span>&nbsp;among others, O’Keefe has etched her name in the hearts of millions of fans for her ecstatic on-screen performances.</span></p><p><span>As a model, Jodi Lyn O’keefe has put her beauty to good use to advertise other hidden talents she has acquired.&nbsp;She is now one of the sought-after star actresses in movies.</span></p><h2><span>Jodi Lyn O’keefe Biography</span></h2><p><span>The youngest of the three, Jodi Lyn O’keefe was born on October 10, 1978 in Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey.&nbsp;She was raised in a family of mixed Austrian, Czech, Polish, Irish and Swedish ancestry.&nbsp;Her mother is Noreen, a housewife, while her father, Jack O’Keefe, is a director of labor relations for Merck.&nbsp;The names of his two sisters are&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Jenna</span></strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Bruyère.</span><br></strong></p><p><span>After her exceptional beauty, O’keefe became a model at the age of 8 with much encouragement from her older sister.&nbsp;She modeled for Gitano Jeans and DreamPhone while learning to play ballet.</span></p><p><span>As a teenager, O’keefe attended Saint John Vianney High School in Holmdel, New Jersey, but halfway through college she left to star in the soap opera Another World (1964), where she was played the role of Marguerite “Maggie” Cory.</span></p><p><span>Although no further information was provided about her educational background, O’keefe said she completed her education by mail because she had to follow her mother who had moved to Hollywood.</span></p><p><span>At the age of 17, Jodi Lyn O’keefe played Cassidy Bridges on Nash Bridges, but her debut came in 1998, when she had a role in&nbsp;</span><i><span>Halloween H20: 20 Years Later</span></i><span>&nbsp;after which she&nbsp;</span><i></i><span>starred in films such as&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Raven: Salvation</span></i><span>,</span><i><span>Everything that’s necessary</span></i><span>and&nbsp;</span><i><span>Devil in the Flesh 2.</span></i></p><p><span>“It was overwhelming at such a young age but I learned a lot.&nbsp;That’s where I learned everything, the longest hours of my life, a show a day.&nbsp;Amazing” she said in an interview.</span></p><p><span>Among the last shots she performed were the highly watched&nbsp;2007 television series&nbsp;</span><i><span>Prison Break&nbsp;</span></i><i><span>,</span></i><span>&nbsp;where she was part of the show’s cast through its third and fourth seasons.&nbsp;Describing her role on the show, O’keefe said it was one of her toughest roles, as Gretchen was “the opposite opposite of her” and “was badass.”</span></p><p><span>Her other roles are in the VH1 TV series&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hit the Ground</span></i><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><i><span>Happy ExMas-</span></i><span>&nbsp;a movie, she both appeared in 2014.&nbsp;</span><i></i><span>She also

Boyfriend</span></h2><p><span>The beauty of Jodi Lyn O’keefe is far beyond pictorial description.&nbsp;Therefore, finding an idol has never been a problem for her.&nbsp;However, she seems to prefer long liaisons.</span></p><p><span>She had been in a relationship for six years with former boyfriend, John Cusack – American actor, producer and screenwriter.&nbsp;The two began their long relationship in 2003, but broke up in 2009, despite Jodi’s strong desire to be with him forever.&nbsp;An insider said John broke up with Jodi because he was unwilling to settle down.</span></p><p><span>It seems O’keefe gave her the best in the relationship.&nbsp;She even tried to vacation in Miami to strengthen their bond.&nbsp;But, his efforts could not keep John.</span></p><p><span>However, O’keefe was never short of love, like before John, she dated several well-known personalities like Jaime Gomez (1998), Don Johnson (1997) and Al Santos (1995).&nbsp;In 2015, she had a charming boyfriend named Douglas Little.</span></p><p><span>Douglas Little is a master of visual communication and storytelling.&nbsp;He specializes in interpreting and

together.</span></p><h2><span>Jodi Lyn O’keefe’s Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Beauty, they say, is power.&nbsp;Jodi has not failed to use the power of her beauty to establish herself in career
