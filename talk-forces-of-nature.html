It just seems to me that they're still the Kami Trio, as they still have their main appearance (somewhat). I guess they'll just keep it at Kami Trio unless it's official revealed that they have different types or something. <a href=# title=User:Pringles>プリングルズ/品客薯片/ప్రింగిల్స్</a> 04:55, 13 May 2012 (UTC) Many kami in Shinto mythology are able to shape-shift their appearances into a wide variety of forms. While Rajin and Fujin are not known for shape-shifting, Inari definitely is, but that doesn't mean that Raijin and Fujin would be out of the question as they're still kami all the same. I personally think that "kami trio" can still work even with the introduction of the new forms, especially considering the shape-shifting tendencies of many kami. <a href=# title="User:Rai Marshall">Rai Marshall</a> 05:35, 13 May 2012 (UTC) I agree with the Duke R. How about 'Prankster Trio'? In fact, why wasn't this used in first place? It is pretty much their main attribute, more than the fact that their appearances are based on Kami. Furthermore, there is quite some speculation that the new formes are based on Aztec mythology, in which case the term "Kami" is indeed a very partial description. -<a href=# title="User:Ash Pokemaster">Ash_Pokemaster</a> 08:50, 19 May 2012 (UTC)<h2><span id=.27us.27_end></span><span class=mw-headline id="'us'_end">'us' end</span></h2><p>All the names of the pokemon end in 'us'.
