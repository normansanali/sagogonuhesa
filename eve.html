Eve Jihan Jeffers was born on <strong>November 10, 1978,</strong> in a Philadelphia housing project and is currently <strong>45 years old.</strong> Julie and Jerry, her parents, were managers of a publishing company and a chemical factory, respectively. Eve’s parents divorced when she was 12 years old. She had lost touch with her father. Aside from that, there is no further detail about Eve’s siblings or her early childhood life.</p><p>She excelled at poetry while attending Martin Luther King High School. Eve was also a talented artist and a regular on the junior talent show circuit before switching to hip-hop at the age of 13. She and her friend Jennifer Pardue formed the short-lived rap duo Edjp.</p><h2><span id=Professional_life>Professional life</span></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-107774 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eve-in-the-talk-show-The-Talk.jpg alt=Eve width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-107774 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Eve in the talk show The Talk (Source: Instagram)</p><p>Eve moved to New York after high school but ended up performing as a stripper. Unsatisfied with her circumstances, she decided to pursue a music career and got a break at the age of 18. Dr. Dre signed her to Aftermath Entertainment as Eve of Destruction. However, she was let go after just a few months. Though, a song she made for the label ended up on the soundtrack of the 1998 film Bulworth. It was her first real achievement. Eve was brought to the Ruff Ryders label by Dre’s parent label, Interscope, and they signed her up and worked hard to prepare her for the big time.</p><p>Ruff Ryders’ belief in Eve was rewarded when her song “What Ya Want” reached the Billboard Top 40 in 1999. Her debut album, Let There Be Eve…, debuted at Number 1 in its first week of release in September. Eve became only the third female hip-hop artist, after Lauryn Hill and Foxy Brown, to have an album debut at No. 1. Scorpion, Eve’s second album, was released in March 2001 and sold 1.5 million copies. Its lead single, “Who’s That Girl?” rocketed her to international stardom. The second single, “Let Me Blow Ya Mind,” a Dr Dre-producedd duet with Gwen Stefani, won a Grammy in 2002. Eve-Olution, her third album, was certified gold the same year. Her collaboration with Alicia Keys, “Gangsta Lovin,'” peaked at No. 2.</p><p>Eve made her acting debut in 2002 with a role in Vin Diesel’s action-adventure film xXx. She co-starred in the hit comedy Barbershop alongside Ice Cube. Eve has starred in the film’s two sequels, released in 2004 and 2016. She appeared in the UPN comedy series Eve in 2003.</p><h4>Recent Year</h4><p>After Eve-Olution, Jeffers mostly limited herself to guest appearances on other artists’ albums, such as Amerie, Kelly Rowland, and Ludacris. In 2007, she released two singles, “Tambourine” and “Give It to You,” but her fourth album did not become popular as planned. Eve and Interscope had conflicts, and Eve left the label in 2010. Lip Lock was finally published independently by her. However, revenues were disappointing.</p><h2><span id=Achievements_and_Net_Worth_2024>Achievements and Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>Eve has received several awards, including a Grammy, a BET Award, a Teen Choice Award, and an MTV Video Music Award. From 2017 to 2020, she co-hosted the American talk show “The Talk”. She was also ranked 46th on VH1’s list of the 50 Greatest Hip Hop Artists.</p><p>Eve’s professional work as a musician, musician, actress, and TV show host has earned her a good income. Eve began her professional music career at the age of 20 and has since risen to become one of the most well-known singers and actresses in the Hollywood film industry.</p><p>She has received many awards and honors, including a Grammy Award. Her albums, films, series, and shows are her source of income. Eve believes her <strong>net worth</strong> is about $10 million, as a result of her years of hard work. She has made money from sponsorship deals with well-known brands such as Pepsi, Clarica, and Sprite.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-107773 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eve-with-her-husband-Maximillion-Cooper.jpg alt=Eve width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-107773 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Eve with her husband Maximillion Cooper (Source: Instagram)</p><p>She is a married lady.
