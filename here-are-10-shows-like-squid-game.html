As she runs to the building’s rooftop, she quickly realizes that she is in a totally abandoned world of high-rise buildings, many of which are connected together by bridges.

Re:Mind follows a group of eleven high-schoolers who wake up in a strange European mansion. They soon realize that they’re all chained to the floor by their feet. As they try to work out how to escape, they slowly start to vanish one by one. Gradually they learn that they all share a common past that might explain their strange situation.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Featuring a brilliant, suspenseful plot and a great atmosphere,&nbsp;Re:Mind&nbsp;will keep you guessing for the entire series. While its story is very different from&nbsp;Squid Game’s,&nbsp;the two share a similar tone and atmosphere, making them excellent companion pieces.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>6. Panic</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Much like&nbsp;Squid Game,&nbsp;Panic&nbsp;looks at how far people will go for money, especially if that money will allow them to escape their unfortunate circumstances.&nbsp;In the tiny town of Carp, Texas, a strange tradition takes place every year in which a group of 23 high school graduates takes part in a contest called Panic. The winner of Panic gets $50,000, which is enough money to escape the small dead-end town.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Panic is extremely dangerous and pushes the contestants to their limits. Those who fail often end up hurt or killed, making the contestants question just how much they’re willing to do to win.&nbsp;The series follows Heather Nill, a girl desperate for money, as she interacts with her family and other contestants only to learn from the horrible fates of several past contestants that Panic is more than it seems.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>An utter thrill ride,&nbsp;Panic&nbsp;touches on many of&nbsp;Squid Game’s themes, but rather than the hyper-stylized environments found in&nbsp;Squid Game, Panic&nbsp;feels like it could take place in any small town you know, adding a more chilling edge to the proceedings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/155853689978200069-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAAABXlt7Skny36UA9hDgsK0f_vScFeMVe1nCvHp9HhqiI5iIkK2BqUahsgOb7OQshh5JUFjPGRU3iHd8hIgBDtbZKvnxXs7.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MV5BOTNlNDA2ZDMtMTIxNi00OWRiLThmMzktYWY4MTM4NWFjZTU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIyMzk3NDU1._V1_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAAABX5YbszfP6qwMvZCYV1bWmat1AaBM3XozC5O5lFrojsfiGASnagIU7Vxue9NPXws0Z4ZM01AxMR9k6AFbZlV8bd6VlgL.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MV5BMDIzNjBkNDUtYzEyZi00MzUwLWI3YjItMzI4ZWE4OTcwMmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5MzIyOA@@._V1_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/111-1116672_killing-harmony-wolpeyper-danganronpa-v3-killing-harmony.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MV5BMjJlNzYyZGEtNWUzMi00MTQ3LWFiNWItYWQzMDAxNDAwZjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2NDE3Mzc@._V1_-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/maxresdefault-89.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MV5BMDUxNThmMDctYzFmYi00N2Y5LTg2Y2EtNDM2ZmY2NWFkMDIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE2MDU0NzAw._V1_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/maxresdefault-90.jpg><h3 data-injectable=false>5.

These sixteen students are trapped in the academy by the bear-like machine Monokuma and forced to participate in a series of deadly games.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>As an extra twist, if you don’t kill someone, then you’ll be trapped in the building forever. After every murder, a trial is held where the other students try to work out who the murderer was, and whoever they pick is executed.&nbsp;This is just scratching the surface of the story. The games and anime are dense, featuring lots of lore and many subplots that follow the various students and their relationships.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Danganronpa: The Animation&nbsp;might seem weird at first, but those who stick with it are treated to some unique scenarios and fantastic storylines.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>4. 3%</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Squid Game&nbsp;proves that timing is a crucial part of popularity. Despite being very similar in format, style, and tone, 2016’s 3% was chronically overlooked when it was released on Netflix. This is a crying shame, as the series is fantastic, and many critics argue that it’s better than&nbsp;Squid Game&nbsp;in several ways.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>3% is set in an unspecified future where society is divided into two classes. Those who live in the Inland suffer from horrible poverty while those who live on an island called Offshore live in pure luxury. When Inland citizens turn 20, they’re allowed to compete in something called The Process. This is a series of trials that, while simple at first, quickly get more extreme, leading to The Process only having a 3% success rate.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>The series is a fascinating look at how society splits into the haves and have nots and examines how perfect communities can quickly turn inward and start to further divide themselves due to human greed.&nbsp;3%&nbsp;strips away a lot of&nbsp;Squid Game’s&nbsp;visual style&nbsp;and presents an amazingly raw critique of capitalism and how it drives people to take extreme actions.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>3. Gantz</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/vPiCTBE9rRc</figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Gantz&nbsp;is extremely infamous in anime circles, and after watching it, you’ll quickly realize why. Written by Hiroya Oku, the series follows Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, two high school students who get hit by a train while trying to save a drunk man who has fallen onto the tracks.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>When the two wake up in an apartment, they learn that they’re being forced to participate in a game where they have to kill aliens living on Earth. The being behind this game, a strange sphere called the Gantz, gives them a series of powerful weapons and special abilities to help with this. But as they complete missions, they soon learn the truth about their strange situation.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>Violent, gory, and stylish,&nbsp;Gantz&nbsp;deserves its infamy. It’s wholly unique and inverts many typical anime tropes. While not a death game in the traditional sense,&nbsp;Gantz&nbsp;shows people being forced to do horrible things to survive and is full of gripping drama.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>2. Liar Game&nbsp;</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>This South Korean television series is based on the manga by Shinobu Kaitani, which has also spawned two other live-action movies, both of which offer a unique take on the source material.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=617 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>Liar Game&nbsp;follows Nam Da-jung, an innocent student who takes part in a hidden camera audition. They do so well in this audition that they’re invited to compete in a strange reality show called&nbsp;Liar Game. This game is billed as a psychological survival game where players trick and manipulate each other, with the winner getting a massive ₩10 billion prize pool. The losers end up in more debt than they started with. Da-jung, desperate to pay off their debts, agrees to take part in the game, but they quickly find that the other players will do anything to win, forcing Da-jung to play dirty.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Unlike&nbsp;Squid Game,&nbsp;Liar Game&nbsp;is less gory and more psychological, featuring a lot of gambits and trickery as the players try to out-logic each other. This means that the show is much slower but still highly gripping as you try to work out all the plans that are being set in motion.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>1. Kaiji</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Nobuyuki Fukumoto’s&nbsp;Kaiji&nbsp;began life as a manga in the pages of Weekly Young Magazine in 1996. It soon got an anime adaptation under the title of&nbsp;Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor,&nbsp;which was produced by legendary animation studio Madhouse.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=true>The series follows Kaiji Itō, a broke young man who lives in Tokyo. Unable to find steady work, Kaiji ends up falling into a depressive spiral. One day a man called Yūji Endō arrives at Kaiji’s home. Yūji tells Kaiji that he is in more debt than he thought, as he co-signed a loan for a coworker, which that coworker then defaulted on. Yūji informs Kaiji that he can spend 10 years paying off the debt or enter an underground gambling tournament on a ship. Kaiji opts for the boat and soon finds that the ship’s rock paper scissors tournament is much more dangerous than it seems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Kaiji&nbsp;features many of the concepts found in&nbsp;<strong>Squid Game</strong>,&nbsp;including corrupted versions of simple games and all of the ensuing tension you would expect, while also presenting a gripping character-driven narrative.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsdGeZJqqlWJ%2BcXnSoaawq12htqyxjKyorqGUYrSiucRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-chon-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Chon Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-is-hope-a-vampire-and-a-witch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hope Is Officially a Tribrid but Can Someone Explain How?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
