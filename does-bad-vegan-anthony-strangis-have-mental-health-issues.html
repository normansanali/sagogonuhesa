After nearly six years of marriage, their divorce was finalized two months later in August 2018.</p><p>Sarma accused her ex-husband of assaulting her mentally, physically, and sexually throughout their relationship during their 2017 trial.</p><p>She also claims he encouraged her to bankrupt her thriving vegan business.</p><p>Sarma co-founded and co-owned the popular New York City restaurants Pure Food and Wine and One Lucky Duck.</p><p>Her company was forced to close in 2015 after getting numerous complaints.</p><p>Moving on, Sarma was charged with fraud in 2016 and was found guilty in 2017.
