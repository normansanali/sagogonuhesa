The star, born Chelsea Chanel Dudley, has made quite the name for herself on the network over the years, having probably most famously&nbsp;<a href=#>appeared</a> on the hilarious clip show <a href=#>"Ridiculousness,"</a> which first began all the way back in 2011. But that's not the only place you'll know her from, as Chanel has also popped up on "Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory" and "Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood," while also dipping her toe in the music world. Chanel dropped her debut album, "America's Sweetheart," in 2020 and has a slew of singles under her belt (including 2016's "Been On" with French Montana).&nbsp;</p><p>But that's not all! Chanel has also launched her own clothing line, titled LOL Cartel, and swimwear line, Coasty Swim, so it's safe to say this star has built up her portfolio and her bank account over the years. But how much does Chanel West Coast actually make from her main gig hosting "Ridiculousness" and various other TV gigs?</p><h2>Chanel West Coast reportedly makes hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ridiculousness</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/how-much-does-chanel-west-coast-get-paid-for-ridiculousness/chanel-west-coast-reportedly-makes-hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars-from-ridiculousness-1673278430.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Tinseltown/Shutterstock</span><p>It sounds like Chanel West Coast makes a pretty impressive salary from "Ridiculousness." The exact figure? Well, according to <a href=#>Earn the Necklace</a>, the star reportedly makes $142,050 to host "Ridiculousness," making it one of her highest paid TV gigs. The outlet reported she also made an estimated $174,830 from "Wild Grinders," $108,230 from "New Music Live," and another $81,170 from "Fantasy Factory." Not bad. Not bad at all!</p><p>All of that adds up, of course, meaning Chanel West Coast reportedly seems to have a very impressive net worth. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>'s calculations, <a href=#>Chanel, who became a mom in November 2022</a>, is worth a whopping $3 million. It's really no wonder she has <a href=#>a song</a> all about her love of cash!</p><p>But don't think it's all about the money and nothing more for this star, as she's also all about the giving back. Chanel announced she'd been donating proceeds from her album, "America's Sweetheart," to REFORM Alliance, a charity focused on criminal justice that was co-founded by the likes of Meek Mill, Jay-Z, and Robert Kraft (via <a href=#>Complex</a>).</p><h2>How does Chanel West Coast spend her money?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/how-much-does-chanel-west-coast-get-paid-for-ridiculousness/how-does-chanel-west-coast-spend-her-money-1673278430.jpg> <a href=#><span class=gallery-image-credit>Instagram</span></a><p>If <a href=#>Chanel West Coast</a>'s Instagram is anything to go by, this star lives quite the lavish lifestyle — and, hey, who could blame her? In January, Chanel showed off the <a href=#>highlights</a> of a sunny vacation to Miami, which included a flight in a seat that looked a little more extravagant than your standard Economy class. It's not all about vacations, though, as Chanel seems to enjoy the perks of her celebrity in other exciting moments. In December 2022, she shared a stunning photo to <a href=#>Instagram</a> of herself and her partner, Dom Fenison, soaking up a Chargers game from what appeared to be a VIP area with a custom jersey.</p><p>Parties also appear to be a big deal when you're as rich and excited to celebrate as Chanel, as she gave fans a look at her lavish baby shower on <a href=#>Instagram</a> back in October 2022. We know Chanel is a fan of a designer label or two as well, as she made no secret of her love for the finer things when she <a href=#>dropped</a> the track "Versace Robe" back in October 2021. With a net worth and income like Chanel West Coast's? We're guessing she can afford quite a few Versace robes!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmZYV0fI6hprBlnaqwqXnDqJysZZOdrq%2Bxy2aunqukYrCwrdKtZKCdpGK9orXDZp2oql2ntqW1wq6jqK2jo7K0v44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-in-the-box-holiday-hours.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jack in the Box Holiday Hours</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./morgan-wallen-recent-controversy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Has Morgan Wallen's Recent Controversy Impacted His Net Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
