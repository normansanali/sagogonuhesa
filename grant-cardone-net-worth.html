All these engagements are sources of Grant Cardone’s net worth.</p><p>So just how rich is Grant Cardone, as of late 2017? Authoritative sources estimate that the current net worth of this entrepreneur is as much as $350 million, accumulated during his working life which began in the early 1980s.</p><h3>Grant Cardone Net Worth $350 Million</h3><p>Grant Cardone was born to parents Concetta and Curtis Louis Cardone, and raised in a family with his four siblings including a twin. He was educated at LaGrange High School, and went on to further education at McNeese State University, from where he graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor’s degree majoring in accounting. Great understanding of accounting helped Grant Cardone to eventually add much financially to the size of his net worth.</p><p>However, after graduation he didn’t work specifically in this field, actually becoming a car salesman, and moving around the US, living in Chicago, Lake Charles, Houston in Texas, La Jolla in California, and finally settling down in Los Angeles. Grant worked in a sales training company for some time, before serving in the CEO position of Freedom Motorsports Group Inc. Then, he founded and successfully ran his own businesses, The Cardone Group and Cardone Enterprises, the first of which concentrates on real estate operations, and the second consulting on customizing sales pr<span class=_dgc>ocesses and improving customer experience, including for such companies as Wells Fargo, Google and Ford. His businesses </span>are the main sources of Grant’s net worth.</p><p>In addition, Grant Cardone added to his wealth as the author of the books “Sell To Survive” (2008), “The Closer’s Survival Guide” (2009),”If You’re Not First, You’re Last” (2010), “The 10X Rule” (2011) and “Sell or be Sold” (2012). The number one seller according to Nobles, Barnes and Amazon on The Wall Street Journal’s and The New York Time’s best seller list, has been “If You’re Not First, You’re Last” (2010).</p><p>Moreover, Cardone was seen on the National Geographic Channel in the reality television series “Turnaround King” (2011), which was focused on Cardone running his businesses. Grant also appeared in the reality television series “How’d You Get So Rich?” (2010) created by <a href=#>Mark Burnett</a>, Barry Poznick and John Stevens. The success story of his business was portrayed as well as showing a tour of Cardone’s home. His appearances on television added somewhat to his net worth, but also increased the public exposure and hence popularity of the businessman.</p><p>Among various awards, in 2010, he was honoured with the McNeese State University Distinguished Alumnus Award.</p><p>Concerning his private life, Grant Cardone is married to the actress Elena Lyons, and the family has two daughters. Cardone is a member of the religious movement, The Church of Scientology, which is focused on administration, practice and dissemination of Scientology (body of beliefs and related practices). He promotes Scientology as well as Dianetics&nbsp; – the set of practices and ideas created using metaphysical relationship between body and mind – sponsoring the drivers of NASCAR as the head of Freedom Motorsports.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.989860583016><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Grant Cardone</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$350 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 21, 1958</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Lake Charles, Louisiana, United States</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Entrepreneur, Presenter, Writer, Radio personality, Salesman</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>La Grange High School, McNeese State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Elena Lyons (m. 2004)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Scarlett Cardone, Sabrina Cardone</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Concetta Cardone, Curtis Louis Cardone</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Gary Cardone</td></tr><tr readability=0.34782608695652><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/cardonesuccess</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/grantcardone</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27450980392157><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/106268128704132883440</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/grantcardone/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>LinkedIn</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.linkedin.com/in/grantcardone</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1480804</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>McNeese State University Distinguished Alumnus Award (2010)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Turnaround King (2011, TV Series)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=2.5714285714286><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>International sales expert.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Father, with <a href=#>Elena Lyons</a>, of two daughters.</td></tr></table><p><a href=# class="shortc-button medium green"><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</a></p><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqCpmqakYrCivsOopZ5lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michaela-mcmanus-career-earnings-and-networth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michaela McManus career earnings and net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dudes-showing-off-duds-nyt-crossword.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dudes showing off duds Crossword Clue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
