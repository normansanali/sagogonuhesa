He leads from the top down. And he's kind of inspiring to be around. There's no one else like him, he's the last movie star of the old kind."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One Actress That Turned Down A Role To Star Alongside Both Nicole Kidman And Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p>Pegg continues, "When I first met him, it was my first time to Hollywood," he told the outlet. "He came to set the first day we met, he immediately made me feel very welcome, very at home, was incredibly generous. Over the 17 years that we've been friends, I feel lucky to get to see a part of him that everyone else wants to see, which is just the guy," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And he is just a guy. He's an extraordinary guy.

That held true during the shoot of Minority Report. The actor literally stepped aside mid-scene in order to fix an issue his children were having.</p><p>"There were times that I was about ready to say “Action,” and the phone rang. If it was Tom’s kids, everything stopped for that. Just when he was preparing for probably the hardest scene he has in the whole movie, the phone rang. Anybody else would have looked up with anger in their eyes, but he immediately broke character and walked off and took the call."</p><p>"Connor or Isabella had stuck an eraser in their eye or something like that. It was not serious, but Dad came to the rescue. I thought it was amazing. I have been known to say [when talking about his own kids], “I’ll call them back after the shot.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Tom Cruise, his dream was always to be a father and as this story indicates, he takes his role very seriously. Cruise still holds a close relationship with both kids, while his closeness to Suri seems to be strained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdmL%2B2tdKeZLCZo2LBqbGMqZyrnpWYwW6zxKerpZ2dlrtuw8itn2aZXZi8rbjEmp6unV2eu26tjJyYp5yZmXquu8yepa1lk5bCqLTTZpmyZZaWu7R7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-josh-oconnor-3253962.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Josh OConnor?
