The most interesting are the city’s independent inns and guesthouses, some of which are located in historic Sunday Houses, modest cottages that hosted early settlers who traveled in on weekends for church services and supply runs. Porchlight Hospitality’s two </span><a href=#><span>Town Haus</span></a><span> suites, on a Sunday House property, have cozy bedrooms and ample bathrooms, plus sitting areas, kitchenettes, and private courtyards with a fire pit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For a romantic option, stay at adults-only </span><a href=#><span>Cotton Gin Village</span></a><span>. Its rustic-meets-luxe cabins form their own diminutive neighborhood, connected via gravel walking paths, flagstone patios, koi ponds, and waterfalls. The cottages are only a stone’s throw from the excellent Cabernet Grill, one of the best restaurants in the region.</span></p><p>Where to Eat & Drink</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-358417 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-pastemagazine-com-public-bucket.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/18175827/Ottos_Credit_Trish_Rawls.jpg alt="Otto's" width=676 height=507 data-eio-rwidth=676 data-eio-rheight=507 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-358417 class=wp-caption-text>Otto’s German Bistro (Credit: Trish Rawls)</p><p><span>Fredericksburg might measure only 10 square miles, but it houses more than 100 options for eating and drinking, from food trucks to full-service restaurants. Thank your higher power, then set yourself to the difficult task of narrowing down your choices for just three meals—and a generous snack or sip—a day.</span></p><p><span>Start your morning at </span><a href=#><span>Twisted Sisters Bake Shop</span></a><span>, just off the main drag on Washington Street. The cafe serves flavorful coffee and espresso, breakfast tacos, and a rotating selection of freshly baked pastries, including cinnamon rolls large enough to feed three people.</span></p><p><span>For lunch, don’t miss </span><a href=#><span>Eaker Barbecue</span></a><span>. Born as a food truck in Houston, the restaurant fuses the best of Texan and Korean cuisine. Meat lovers will appreciate the brisket and ribs; vegetarians should load up on the rich mac and cheese and pickled sides, like spicy cucumber salad and kimchi.</span></p><p><span>Dinner offers the greatest variety. </span><a href=#><span>Otto’s German Bistro</span></a><span> pairs upscale versions of authentic schnitzel, wurst, and knödel&nbsp;(dumplings) with a large list of German and Austrian wines and craft beers. Sun-washed and soothing, </span><a href=#><span>Hill Country Herb Garden</span></a><span> offers a mashup of American and international dishes, like sushi bowls and pork chops with lychee barbecue sauce. At </span><a href=#><span>Cabernet Grill</span></a><span>, choose from a selection of Hill Country standouts, like Texas “Twinkies” (bacon-wrapped jalapenos stuffed with beer sausage and cheddar) or grilled shrimp atop velvety grits. Pair each with a selection from Cabernet Grill’s all-Texas wine list.</span></p><p><span>The wine and beer scene around Fredericksburg deserves a guide of its own. If you’ve only got a few hours to spare, start in town at </span><a href=#><span>La Bergerie</span></a><span>, a Parisian-influenced wine bar, and </span><a href=#><span>Ferris & Fletch</span></a><span>, a family-owned winemaker that sells accessible reds, whites, and roses.&nbsp;</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-358418 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-pastemagazine-com-public-bucket.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/18180450/Fredericksburg_Brewing_Company_Sausage_plate_credit_Marc_Bennett.jpg alt="Fredericksburg Brewing Company" width=676 height=366 data-eio-rwidth=676 data-eio-rheight=366 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-358418 class=wp-caption-text>Fredericksburg Brewing Company (Credit: Marc Bennett)</p><p><span>Outside of the downtown, your options expand. </span><a href=#><span>Becker Vineyards</span></a><span>, located on a 56-acre estate with lavender fields, is one of Hill Country’s oldest and best-known wineries. Be sure to also seek out smaller, terroir-focused venues, including the thinking tippler’s boutique cellar, </span><a href=#><span>Ab Astris</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=#><span>Meierstone Vineyards</span></a><span>, a fifth-generation working ranch that produces sustainably-minded wines.</span></p><p><span>In a town founded by Germans, you don’t have to go far for a glass of pilsner or stout. Multi-award-winning </span><a href=#><span>Fredericksburg Brewing Company</span></a><span>, which produces 20-plus varieties, is the oldest continuously operating brewpub in Texas. Meanwhile, </span><a href=#><span>Altstadt Brewery</span></a><span>—housed in a handsome, Old World-style complex that includes a tap room, biergarten, lounge, and restaurant—features about a dozen beers on tap.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The city’s newest spirits producer, </span><a href=#><span>Dietz Distillery</span></a><span>, is one of its most promising. They craft artisanal gin and vodka, used in a curated list of creative cocktails. Downtown, </span><a href=#><span>Hondo’s on Main</span></a><span> is a local favorite for its margaritas.</span></p><p>What to Do in Fredericksburg</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-358415 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-pastemagazine-com-public-bucket.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/18175113/Luckenbach_Texas_credit_Fredericksburg_CVB.jpg alt="Luckenbach Texas" width=676 height=380 data-eio-rwidth=676 data-eio-rheight=380 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-358415 class=wp-caption-text>Luckenbach Texas, credit Fredericksburg CVB</p><p><span>Get an overview of Fredericksburg history and architecture aboard a vintage trolley via </span><a href=#><span>Fredericksburg Tours.</span></a><span> Or hoof it around town, stopping in historic spots like </span><a href=#><span>Marktplatz</span></a><span>, a public park that hosts a variety of festivals and concerts and is home to </span><a href=#><span>Vereins Kirche</span></a><span>, an octagonal white building reconstructed in the style of the original 1847 town church and meeting house.

Both Enchanted Rock and the </span><a href=#><span>Lyndon B.
