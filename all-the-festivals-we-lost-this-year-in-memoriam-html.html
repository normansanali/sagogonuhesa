(Global Citizen, we see you over there at the end of September, but, sorry, according to our charts, you count as autumnal.) It was another overcrowded year that kicked off with <a href=#>Beychella</a>, powered through heatwaves, various types of deluges, and, in Germany, <a href=#>a tornado</a>, then closed out last weekend in Philadelphia with<a href=#> Jay-Z’s Made in America</a> festival (which <a href=#>nearly didn’t happen</a>). Luckily, 2018 avoided a total repeat of last year’s<a href=#> Fyre Festival</a> debacle (phew), but several festivals did go up in flames. Retire your flower crowns, rompers, and drug stashes for the winter and let’s pour one out for all the festivals we lost this year — some gone for good, others on hiatus, and a few on death watch.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjlqr4ncm002k2c64g26ggrph@published>The Graveyard</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjlsg2py9001v2c61v75zezqv@published data-word-count=48><strong>Sasquatch!

The festival also <a href=#>reportedly</a> had scheduling and contract issues with top artists on the lineup.<br><strong>Why we’ll miss it:</strong> Its lineup was a better mix of genres (Kacey Musgraves, T-Pain, Robert Plant) than you’ll find at most festivals.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjlwfqy4h00462c610ogs3xja@published data-word-count=108><strong>Curveball Festival (2018–2018)</strong><br><strong>Cause of death:</strong> Flooding.

The 20-year-old YouTuber thought she could take on the alleged corruption of <a href=#>the annual YouTube circus VidCon</a> with <a href=#>her own eponymous rival convention</a> across the street in Anaheim, California, on the same weekend this year’s VidCon was held. To make her dream a reality, Tana partnered with a company called Good Times Entertainment, run by a 22-year-old, to organize the event. A very bad time ensued: Tickets were oversold for a too-small venue, security was nonexistent, and thousands of fans left waiting in the heat sustained severe sunburns. The festival was shut down six hours into its first day, with police citing overcrowding. The debacle sparked an entire conspiracy theory docuseries from fellow YouTuber (and TanaCon supporter) Shane Dawson, a separate extended explanation video from Tana herself, and endless memes comparing the mess to Fyre Festival.<br><strong>Why we’ll miss it:</strong> The drama.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjlwdrpo4002t2c61sz5nvpej@published data-word-count=98><strong>XO Music Festival (2018–2018)</strong><br><strong>Cause of death: </strong>It was a scam. Like a Fyre Festival 2.0, XO Music Festival was meant to be held in Antioch, California, in July with a mishmash lineup of rappers old and new. Except it was <a href=#>canceled three days before opening day</a> due to “the promoters’ lack of fulfilling contractual obligations.” In other words, artists were never paid and some allegedly were never even officially booked.

In a<a href=#> statement</a>, the festival said it failed to “obtain a workable multi-day permit” at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, which they’d hoped to move to after two years held in the parking lot at Citi Field in Queens.

Technically, Glastonbury has always allotted itself “fallow years,” or years the festival takes off to allow the farmland in Somerset, England, where the festival is held, to recover: 2018 was designated as a fallow year, and the festival is set to return in 2019.

Though its first few years went off smoothly, <a href=#>Panorama 2018 fell victim to the heavy rain</a> that usually turns Gov Ball into a swamp. Its first day had to be canceled due to the storms, and the rest of the weekend was a muddy mess. The inclement weather also caused Lil Wayne to miss his set the next day.<br><strong>Why we miss it: </strong>The next two days still happened, so technically not all was missed.

Drake’s annual Toronto festival went on for eight consecutive years. This year, with no announcement, it just hasn’t happened, at least not yet (it could move to the fall or winter, who knows). Drake has not acknowledged his festival’s absence this year, instead touring through Toronto with Migos with no festival attached. He mentioned that <a href=#>a recent New York City concert carried the same OVO energy</a>, but that’s about it.

The annual nonprofit jazz festival in Syracuse, New York, had to take its first-ever year off after failing to secure a sponsor to fund the festival. “A funny thing happened on the way to Jazz Fest this year,” founder Frank Malfitano <a href=#>said</a>. “We decided that we could not mount it. We had a great festival planned. Unfortunately we couldn’t raise the money.” He plans to bring back the festival “bigger and better than ever” in 2019.<br><strong>Why we miss it:</strong> It’s our closest and best jazz festival.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjlwgb66y004v2c61owqlgo81@published data-word-count=106><strong>Made in America Festival (2012–)</strong><br><strong>Cause of near-death:</strong> Venue change. Jay-Z’s festival was nearly canceled this year and forced to vacate its usual Philadelphia space at the Benjamin Franklin Parkway after alleged miscommunication between the festival and Philadelphia’s mayor Jim Kenney. In an<a href=#> open letter to the mayor</a>, Jay-Z accused him of trying to shut down the festival and “evict” him from the popular spot. In the end, the matter was resolved, Jay-Z was permitted to keep the festival at the parkway, and this year’s festival went on as planned over Labor Day weekend.<br><strong>Why we would’ve missed it</strong>: It’s the best way to close out the summer.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjlxo4fzq001c2c64rj16p0d8@published data-word-count=87><strong>Dreamville Festival (2018-)</strong><br><strong>Cause of near-death: </strong>J.

In a tweet announcing the cancellation, Cole hinted that the festival will live on as they are “working to get another date.” (He claims 30,000 were expected to attend and will be refunded.)<br><strong>Why we would’ve missed it: </strong>We don’t know yet!

The festival, created by Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon and the National’s Aaron Dessner, has decided to take 2019 off after four consecutive years to work out some kinks. “After our Senior year, we find ourselves wanting to move out, change things, and take stock of who we’ve become,” they wrote in a <a href=#>statement</a>, clarifying that the festival won’t be moving from its Eau Claire, Wisconsin home. “While it will be hard for us to break the chain of momentum and the positive impact the festival has had on our community, we have fresh, clear ideas of how to make it even better.” The festival will return in 2020.<br><strong>Why we would’ve missed it:</strong> A chance to almost always hear unreleased Bon Iver in the wilderness and support artist-owned festivals, duh.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjlr3737g001l2c61ut34sx10@published>Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjlwedtj500382c61cj7wqqvj@published data-word-count=139><strong>Afropunk’s integrity (2005–2018)</strong><br><strong>Cause of near-death: </strong>Selling out. By most accounts, Afropunk, the annual Brooklyn festival (now also held in other cities) by and for black people, has lost what made it punk. In 2015, the festival began charging for tickets and has attracted more and more corporate sponsors in a growing push to compete with the festival big dogs. In 2018, the festival was accused of <a href=#>kicking two attendees out of the VIP section</a> for wearing a shirt critical of the company. (Afropunk called it an “unfortunate incident” in a statement.) Days later, its longtime editor-in-chief, Lou Constant-Desportes,<a href=#> resigned</a> citing “gaslighting, disrespect, victim-blaming, and exploitation.” In his statement, he accused the festival of “performative activism” and of forcing him to sign a NDA.<br><strong>Why we’ll miss it</strong>: Safe spaces are hard to come by.
