Thomas, whom she portrayed for 4 seasons (168 episodes).</span></p><p><span>The role brought him a lot of praise, exposing him to a wider audience.&nbsp;Coleman went on to have recurring roles on shows like Titanic, Waterloo Road and Room at the Top before landing her big-screen debut as Connie in Captain America: The First Avenger.</span></p><p><span>Coleman’s next big role on the small screen was as Clara Oswald on the long-running BBC science fiction show Doctor Who.&nbsp;In May 2013, Coleman began using the shortened version of her name – Jenna Coleman professionally.&nbsp;She appeared in her second feature, the romantic drama,&nbsp;</span><span>Me Before You</span><span>&nbsp;in 2016.</span></p><p><span>Her role as Queen Victoria in Victoria won her a Golden Nymph Award

relationship was only confirmed a few months later.&nbsp;In August 2017, after about a year of dating, rumors started circulating that the couple got engaged.</span></p><p><span>The rumors started after Coleman was spotted during the Victoria screening wearing a vintage ring on his finger.&nbsp;However, later that same month, she was spotted several times without the ring, so maybe it was just a fashion piece…or not.&nbsp;Coleman and Hughes are very private about their romantic life and give little to no information.&nbsp;However, the eyes of the media won’t stop hiding, not when they play one of the most famous couples on a show that garnered huge traction.</span></p><p><span>Details of OK!&nbsp;Magazine emerged in October 2017 that the couple had moved in together.&nbsp;Although the
