But Wendy has proven again and again that she is incapable of any decency. Her obsession with our lives has reached a new low. And I'm tired of taking the high road.</p><p>“Despite my anger, I chose not to respond publicly to her unhealthy fixation with my&nbsp;husband&nbsp;and our marriage. It was clear that she was sick, and that she was struggling with a lot of issues including self-hate and low-self esteem.”</p><p>Tamika continued: "In an obvious attempt to increase ratings for her and biopics, her struggling TV show, and her burnt-out career, Wendy has once again targeted my husband. It's a pattern that has repeated itself for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633807625.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/330eb21d-39da-473b-a5fb-44e612887a69.jpg><p>"When I was diagnosed with my cancer years ago, Wendy shared my personal medical information with her listeners live on the air during her radio broadcast. She didn’t care that she was violating my right to privacy, or that I hadn’t shared the news of my diagnosis with my family and friends. She never apologized, never expressed any regret whatsoever.”</p><p>Tamika continued putting Wendy on blast sharing: "Her career is on life support, her husband abandoned her and her ratings for all her projects are down. She is desperate for attention and is trying to use my husband's popularity as a way to get her name trending.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633807626.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633807641.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633807727.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633807662.jpg><p>"How sad that a woman who was once revered in the entertainment industry has reduced herself to a tabloid side note and circus&nbsp;freak! For the record, my marriage is solid, my husband continues to enjoy a successful career, and Wendy will forever be one of the most miserable bitches on the planet.”</p><p>“Over the years, those issues have made her increasingly ugly, both inside and out. and no, the amount of plastic surgery can fix the ugliness inside her. Instead of using a platform to uplift women, she has spent her career attacking marriages while her own fell apart. She criticized celebrities battling addiction despite her own struggles with substance abuse. There's no limit on how low she will go in the name of making headlines."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633807068.jpg><p>During an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview,</a> last week with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> DJ Suss One</a>, Wendy, who has been open about her past drug abuse, said she once took the Wu-Tang Clan member home to her penthouse.</p><p><a href=#>Wendy</a> said of her night with the rapper: "I smoked a blunt with&nbsp;Method Man&nbsp;while I gave him a bath and it was a one-night-stand. And he'll deny it, maybe not."</p><p>She added the story wouldn't be included in her film <a href=#>Wendy Williams: The Movie</a>, stating: "It&nbsp;wasn't in the [biopic]&nbsp;because Method Man is still very angry at me.

The fight was ridiculous. The whole Wu-Tang was there. But it was only Meth up in the rafters."</p><p>Wendy and Method Man, whose real name is Clifford Smith Jr., then left the club hand in hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000619544228.png><p>She recalled: "He rolled a blunt, we smoked a blunt, we watched the fight, we heard the gunshots, the cops came in."</p><p>Wendy continued: "People didn't even realize at the time it was Wendy and one of the biggest stars, the leader of the biggest group in the world, just left, got in her Pathfinder, and went back to her penthouse in Jersey City where she bathed him in her jacuzzi tub and smoked more weed, you know, that was back in the coke days.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"I don't remember what he did, I'm not gonna implicate him on that."</p><p>Last week, Wendy also <a href=#>wore her "engagement ring"</a> from her ex-husband Kevin Hunter.</p><p>She shared: "Every diamond is gutted out, and I thought I would wear it for a funny, funny haha."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Kevin and Wendy married in 1997 and have a 20-year-old son, Kevin Jr.</p><p>The Sun reached out for comment from both Wendy Williams and Method Man.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Wendy Williams SLAMS ex-husband's 'mistress' Sharina Hudson by name for driving Ferrari with 'her money'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqYmmFc4WPaKSerJiksW65wKdksKGWmnq0uMCmqmarmZi4bsPEp5uyZaeeua21wKaqZqCfpLimsIyup2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paradox-rift-build-26-battle-box-tcg.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paradox Rift Build &amp;amp; Battle Box (TCG)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mattia-altobelli.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mattia Altobelli - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
