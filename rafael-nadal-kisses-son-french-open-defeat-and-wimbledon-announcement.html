Despite his loss, the 37-year-old appeared to put on a fight during the match.&nbsp;</p><p id=ew1TKlqGp1 data-wc=31>Without giving too much away, Rafael did not confirm whether this would be his final time at the French Open – the tournament he has won 14 times in his career.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyT59q8gBV data-wc=55>"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent - but if it is I enjoyed it," he said.
