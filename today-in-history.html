But after King James I came to power in 1603, he imprisoned Raleigh in the Tower of London for trying to depose him.</p><p>James released Raleigh in 1616 to try to find the legendary golden city of El Dorado, but imprisoned him and sentenced him to death on his return on charges of trying to incite a war between Spain and England. He was beheaded in Old Palace Yard.</p><h2>1929: The Stock Market Crashes On ‘Black Tuesday’</h2><p>The New York Stock Exchange crashes, helping to trigger the <a href=# rel=noopener>Great Depression</a>. Stock prices had been falling since September, and they plummeted starting on Oct. 18, leading to “Black Monday” on Oct. 28, and “Black Tuesday” on Oct. 29 as shareholders sought to take their money out in a panic.</p><p>Overnight, billions of dollars disappeared while the Dow lost 23.05 percent. The American stock market crash came just a month after the London Stock Exchange crashed in September, leading to a global financial meltdown that lasted until World War II.</p><h2>1956: The Suez Crisis Begins</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-389903 alt="Suez Crisis" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/suez-crisis.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-389903 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Fox Photos/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A young Egyptian boy stands among rubble during the Suez Crisis. A British tank is parked behind him.</span></p><p>The Suez Crisis begins when Israel — joined by France and the United Kingdom — invades Egypt. Also known as the Second Arab–Israeli War or the Sinai War, the conflict began because Israel, France, and the U.K. hoped to regain ownership of the Suez Canal, which had been nationalized by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.</p><p>But the Soviet Union threatened to bomb Europe, and the United States threatened Israel, France, and the United Kingdom with economic sanctions. The “war” lasted just nine days before the three allied powers withdrew from Egypt in defeat.</p><h2>1969: Bobby Seale Is Gagged During Trial</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bobby Seale</a> is gagged and chained to his seat while standing trial for his role in organizing protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. A co-founder of the Black Panthers and one of the “Chicago Eight,” Seale had been accused of conspiracy to incite a riot during the convention in Chicago, which was rocked by anti-war protestors.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-292171 alt="Abbie Hoffman With David Dellinger And Bobby Seale" width=900 height=605 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/abbie-hoffman-with-david-dellinger-and-bobby-seale.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-292171 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>John Olson/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>David Dellinger, Abbie Hoffman, and Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale at Seale’s birthday party in New York in 1971.</span></p><p>The judge ordered Seale to be gagged after he repeatedly protested about his lack of legal representation. This lasted for several days of the trial before his case was severed from the other seven men. Seale was later sentenced to 48 months in prison for 16 acts of contempt.</p><h2>2015: China Ends One-Child Policy</h2><p>China ends the one-child policy after 35 years. In the 1970s, China feared overpopulation and began implementing restrictions on the marrying age for adults, the number of children a couple could have, and the time intervals between children. The one-child policy was just one way the Chinese government hoped to curb overpopulation, and they strongly enforced it, primarily in urban centers.</p><p>By 2015, the Chinese government extended the limit to two children per family. In 2021, it was extended again to three children before being scrapped altogether.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ5%2BYwbCuxKtka3E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-cast-of-nickelodeons-drake-josh-doing-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is The Cast Of Nickelodeon's 'Drake &amp;amp; Josh' Doing Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-milne-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Travis Milne Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
