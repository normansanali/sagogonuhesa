She claimed that she too received flirty text messages from the Maroon 5 frontman.</p><p>According to PageSix, Alanna became the fourth woman to speak out regarding Alanna’s behavior.

She alleged that Adam told his friends that the yoga teacher had the “best ass in town and it was cute.” She said that one day he texted her saying, “I want to spend the day with you naked.” The message also came to the knowledge of Alanna’s then-boyfriend and they had a physical altercation but subsequently denied that Adam had any responsibility for the incident.</p><p>Though Alanna started her posts as a way of exposing Adam, she also defended him in her post.</p><p>“Firstly, Adam’s text was not wrong, IMO [in my opinion],” she wrote in the caption of a video of her and Levine practicing yoga together on Instagram. She then added, “Secondly, Adam was not responsible for my abusive ex-boyfriend, or his actions.”</p><p>Alanna made it clear that the only reason she came forward with it was that she was “disappointed” with his responses to other allegations made about him. She wrote, “When you look at the Cause and Effect that came from Adam’s one text, either flirtatious or mis-sent, we can see how cautious and mindful we should be with our actions, and how they affect others”.</p><p>Adam came clean with an official statement saying that he “did not have an affair” but “crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life.” He said, “I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner.”</p><p>PageSix reported that a woman named Alyson Rosef also took to TikTok with a video message Levine allegedly sent her that read, “I shouldn’t be talking to you you know [that] right?” Likewise, a comedian named Maryka took to IG Story on to share her alleged DMs with Adam, which read in part, “I’m now obsessed with you.”</p><h3><strong>Alanna Zabel Age</strong></h3><p>Born in October 1972, Alanna Zabel turned 49 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Alanna Zabel Husband</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Alanna Zabel is currently single.
