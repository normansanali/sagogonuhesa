The previous year, Rebecca was shot and killed, and just a few weeks later, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim was arrested for her murder</a> — here’s an update on where he is now and whether or not the Bliefnicks had children.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=788 data-injectable=true>The public’s first introduction to the Bliefnick’s came — of all places — on the TV game show Family Feud, hosted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Harvey</a>. In 2020, Tim and Becky appeared on the show. When Harvey asked Tim what his biggest mistake was at their wedding, Tim said on air, “Honey, I love you, but, ‘Said I do,'” before he added, “Not my mistake, not my mistake, I love my wife. I’m gonna get in trouble for that, aren’t I?” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a> reported.</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Joking or not, in the years between that 2020 Family Feud appearance and Becky’s 2023 death, Becky tried to get <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a restraining order against her husband for alleged abuse and harassment</a>. When she died, the couple were separated and pursuing a divorce. According to the prosecution, Tim killed his wife because he was jealous and had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seen his estranged wife with another man</a>. Tim’s defense team maintained there was reasonable doubt that Tim was responsible, and that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Becky could have been killed by an intruder instead</a>.</p><h2 id=h-where-is-tim-bliefnick-now data-injectable=false>Where is Tim Bliefnick now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>via Inside Edition/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>In Aug. 2023, Tim Bliefnick was convicted of killing his wife and received three life sentences for the crime with no chance for parole.

You planned this murder. You practiced this murder.

Becky’s sister, Sarah Reilly, said in the aftermath of their mother’s murder, the children were doing the best they could under the circumstances. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KQHA</a>, Reilly said:</p><p>“It’s still heart-wrenching on a day-to-day basis. We continue to move forward the best we can with the support of each other and the support from our friends, and family, and community, and we are just doing our best … We lost Becky, but they lost their mother and their father.”</p>via KHQA<p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Reilly’s comments suggest the three boys may be in her custody, but as of this report, there was no publicly available information to confirm the children’s whereabouts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoZipqJWjsqV506hkraCVYq%2BttcSfpaKbm2K4qrDSZpinnF2staa%2BxGagrGWknrpursuinJ%2BmmZi4brrOsGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./baldurs-gate-3-success-analysis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Baldur's Gate 3 rejected gaming's worst trends and it paid off</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-cohen-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andy Cohen's Net Worth (Updated January 2024)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
