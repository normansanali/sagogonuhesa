You know, Nathan’s gone at work, Moriah’s not in the house,” Ethan says to cameras in the teaser. “There’s a note on the counter. [It] pretty much said that there’s a lot going on and she’s finally moving out and gonna be on her own for the first time. And she was just hoping that we could talk at some point.”</p><p>Ethan then shares that he’s “very frustrated and genuinely surprised” by Moriah’s decision to leave without having a conversation with him. “Moriah had told me before [Olivia and I] left for [a trip to] Europe that she was gonna stay a couple weeks after I got back. But then something happens that she doesn’t like [and she] packs up all her stuff. That does feel a little bit theatrical, if you will,” he explains.</p><p>As Ethan, who wed Olivia in 2018, looks at his sister’s empty room, he remarks, “Well, I won’t lie, I am impressed she got it clean.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>season 5 trailer</a> for Welcome to Plathville points to more drama between Moriah and Ethan’s wife, who used to be best friends. “She was using a made-up story to validate her big emotions,” Moriah tells mom <a href=#><strong>Kim Plath</strong> </a>of Olivia in the teaser.</p><p>Later in the clip, Moriah claims during a confessional that Olivia lied about Kim, 51, using Ethan’s credit card to steal from him. Olivia and Ethan <a href=#>sparked split speculation</a> earlier this year when fans noticed that the pair had stopped posting about each other on social media. However, Olivia shut down the rumors in June by commenting on a @Realiteasquad Instagram post about the supposed drama. “There is a lot of speculation going around, but if Ethan and I had something to share, we would,” she wrote.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Moriah-Plath-Abruptly-Moves-Out-of-Brother-Ethan-s-House-on-Welcome-to-Plathville-1st-Look-255.jpg><p>In addition to documenting the drama between Olivia, Moriah and Ethan, season 5 of Welcome to Plathville, which premieres Tuesday, September 5, on TLC, will follow the Plath family as they navigate Kim and patriarch <a href=#><strong>Barry Plath</strong></a>’s divorce. (The former couple, who announced their split in June 2022, share <a href=#>seven other children</a> in addition to Ethan and Moriah: daughters Hosanna, 33, Lydia, 19, Amber, 14, Cassia, 12, and Mercy, 10, and sons Micah, 22, Isaac, 17, and Joshua, who died at 17-months-old following a farming accident in 2008.)</p><p>In the season 5 teaser, Kim admits that a new romantic connection “definitely gives [her] the warm fuzzies,” while Barry, 55, exercises to cope with the split. “Working out, that’s my new hobby,” he explains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, not everyone in the Plath family is as ready to put the past behind them. “I’m still bitter about the whole divorce,” Micha admits during a confessional in the trailer.</p><p>Season 5 of Welcome to Plathville premieres on TLC Tuesday, September 5, at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6epJOkuqZ506hkqaSRqbW3tculnKxlnaS%2Fqq3HZqSorpWoerDB02amn2WVqbWiutJmn6ito5p6uK3TnJ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-mats-zuccarello-wife-marlene-married-life-family-and-net-worth-531368-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Mats Zuccarello Wife Marlene?
