It is nearly impossible to make it in music, but the lucky few that get huge do it bigger and better than anyone else. Stars like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a> can attest to this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a></strong> has remained one of the biggest forces in all of music, and because of this, she has hauled in millions. Not only does her music make tons of money, but she has also landed herself some lucrative endorsements.</p><p>Let’s take a look at how Taylor Swift secured $26 million for representing Diet Coke!</p><h2 id=her-success-in-music-made-her-a-hot-commodity>Her Success In Music Made Her A Hot Commodity</h2><p>When it comes to handing out endorsements, the biggest brands in the world want to make sure that they are working with a performer that has a huge audience and that has the right image to promote their product. By doing so, these companies are going to get a massive amount of marketing handled, which will make their investment in the star totally worth it.</p><p>Earlier in her career, Swift was a squeaky clean kid who was writing love ballads and songs that could be enjoyed by all ages. Over time, however, she was more than happy to change things around and focus on more than just songs that just talked about one side of love. Instead, she was willing to open up a bit more, and this change in sound also offered a change in perception.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, it was the success of Swift’s album&nbsp;1989 that really changed things for the performer, and the monumental success of that album had a direct hand in her landing the deal with Diet Coke. According to&nbsp;RIAA, the album&nbsp;was able to go 9x Platinum for shipments of 9 million units just in the U.S.</p><p>Swift’s string of hit records to go along with a shift in sound and perception made her a hot commodity, and brands were willing more so than ever to get her on board for a marketing campaign. In order to secure her services, they were going to have to pony up a fortune to the music star.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Taylor Swift And Karlie Kloss Still Close?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-paid-26-million-for-commercials-and-ads>She Was Paid $26 Million For Commercials And Ads</h2><p>Plenty of celebrities land lucrative brand deals, but there aren’t too many out there that will ever come close to matching what Taylor Swift was able to secure when she officially partnered up with Diet Coke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her time promoting the soft drink, Swift was able to net herself a gargantuan $26 million payday. This means that for simply promoting Diet Coke, the singer and actress made more money than virtually most&nbsp;people will even come close to matching in a single lifetime.</p><p>Of course, being part of the Diet Coke team meant more than just sending out a tweet or simply being seen drinking the product. Swift was going to have to put in the work if she wanted to make the big bucks, and this meant a little bit of everything in the marketing arena. Television commercials were the primary fuel to this ad engine.</p><p>Naturally, news of her mega-deal made headlines, and it got people wondering how much other stars were making off of their endorsements. Commercials, billboards, and even social media ads can all be lucrative for stars, and there is more money being passed around than some people even realize. Stars that work with multiple companies are the ones making unfathomable amounts of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift, Rihanna, & Other Celebs Who Went To Prom With Fans</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-landed-other-huge-endorsements>She’s Landed Other Huge Endorsements</h2><p>Taylor Swift pulling down $26 million to work with Diet Coke is a shocking bit of news to hear, but believe us when we say that Swift has worked with plenty of other huge companies over the years, meaning that she has been pocketing millions for longer than most realize.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, Swift has worked with major companies like Sony, AT&T, and CoverGirl. There are still other huge brands that she has worked for, and you had better believe that they all paid a fortune to secure her services for an ad campaign.</p><p>These endorsements, along with album sales, touring, and merchandise have all gone into Swift earning herself a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$400 million</a> net worth. She is still one of the biggest stars on the planet, meaning that her current net worth is more than likely going to increase in unreal ways over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of Taking Selfies In Bed</a></span></p><p>The next time you drink a Diet Coke, just remember that Taylor Swift banked $26 million just to advertise it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift’s Epic New Year’s Eve Costume Party</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbrnAnZxmamZiuqq4y6Kmp2WWp7yuecOinK1lk6S4pns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ian-jeffrey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ian Jeffrey Age, Height, Biography (James Charles Brother) Family, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-die-dani-hampson-die-all-about-her-unexpected-passing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How die Dani Hampson die?
