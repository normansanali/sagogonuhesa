Unfortunately, it is clear that <a href=#>Anderson is upset about Pam and Tommy</a> but the show has reminded many people about the disgusting thing that was done to the former couple. On top of that, thanks to Pam and Tommy’s success, a lot of people have been looking back on the reality of <a href=#>Anderson and Lee’s relationship</a> outside of their infamous tape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Tommy Lee Really Feels About 'Pam And Tommy'</a></span></p><p>Even though Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s relationship sadly didn’t last, both of them still got a lot out of their time together. After all, Anderson and Lee have two sons together, Brandon and Dylan. Sadly, several years ago it was very clear that something big had gone wrong in Tommy and Brandon’s relationship. With that in mind, it begs two obvious questions, what happened between Tommy and Brandon and where does their relationship stand now?</p><h2 id=why-did-tommy-lee-and-his-son-brandon-lee-fight-physically>Why Did Tommy Lee And His Son Brandon Lee Fight Physically?</h2><p>Like a lot of divorced couples, Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson don’t always get along. As a result, it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise to anyone that when Anderson was interviewed by Piers Morgan in 2018, she had some less than complimentary things to say about her ex. Evidently angered by Anderson’s remarks, Tommy went on Twitter to call Morgan and Anderson out. Unfortunately, since the former couple’s son was angered by what Tommy posted, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon confronted his father and then things got violent which resulted in a lot of drama</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early March of 2018, Tommy Lee shocked the world when he posted an image of himself with a fat lip alongside a caption that revealed <a href=#>he’d been punched by his son Brandon</a>. In response to the image going public, Brandon claimed he struck his father in self-defense. According to Brandon, when he confronted his dad, Tommy lunged at him in anger so the son was forced to defend himself. For his part, Tommy put out a statement in which he offered a very different version of events.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Pamela Anderson And Tommy Lee's Son Brandon Thomas Lee?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[Brandon] came in the room angry and my response to Pamela's (Anderson) relentless press about our old relationship, with his dukes up, telling me to get up and fight him. When I stood up he pushed me into a wall. I didn't want to hit my son. I never have and I never will. If I wanted to clock him I would have knocked him on his a**. He had no problem knocking me out. I asked him to leave and he spun around and suckered punched me. Knocked me unconscious." Amazingly enough, there is no doubt that Brandon knocked Tommy out since he took a video of his unconscious father on the floor and later posted it on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After going to a hospital following the punch, Tommy Lee initially claimed that he was going to press charges against his son. Later, the press would get ahold of the 911 call that Tommy’s then-fiancee and current wife Brittany Furlan made following the incident. In the recording, Furlan told the dispatcher she was worried since she alleges that Brandon had firearms in his room. Sadly, after the night where things became physical between Tommy and Brandon, the two men would go on the have a war of words for months on social media.</p><h2 id=does-tommy-lee-get-along-with-his-son-brandon-now>Does Tommy Lee Get Along With His Son Brandon Now?</h2><p>Given how bad things were between Tommy Lee and Brandon Lee for months, it wouldn’t have surprised anyone if the father and son never made peace. However, after a period of months, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon reached out to his father Tommy on Thanksgiving</a> in an attempt to mend fences. As a result of that olive branch, Brandon and Tommy were able to move on. In fact, Tommy even posted a photo of the pair hugging on Instagram in which he professed his love for his son Brandon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, sharing a single hug one night doesn’t mean that Tommy Lee and his son Brandon Lee didn’t immediately go back to fighting. On the bright side, however, three years later in 2021, it seemed very clear that Tommy and Brandon were on better terms. After all, when Brandon threw a launch party for his debut fashion line which he christened Swingers Club, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his father Tommy was in attendance to celebrate</a> that accomplishment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Brandon Thomas Lee's Girlfriend And His Past Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, there are only a handful of people who have any idea how close Tommy Lee and Brandon Lee are on a day-to-day basis. However, based on the publically available information, it seems pretty clear that the father and son are on good terms. At the very least, there has been no indication that things between Tommy Lee and Brandon Lee are anywhere near as explosive as they were that night in March 2018.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>20 Facts About Tommy Lee And Pamela Anderson's Kids</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXay2tbSMraampaliuaaxjJqlnWWSp66vsM6nZJqmlGLEqbHRnmSdp12ptabFjKyrmqaUYsGwsMCyZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-leslie-jordan-partner-danny-thomason-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Leslie Jordan Partner Danny Thomason Now?
