But I’m the person who wants to make sure you have water to drink and wants to make sure you have books to read and somewhere to read them.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s2>Spacey was also <a href=#>accused of sexually assaulting actor <strong>Anthony Rapp</strong></a> at a New York City party in 1986 when Rapp was 14 years old and Spacey was 26.
