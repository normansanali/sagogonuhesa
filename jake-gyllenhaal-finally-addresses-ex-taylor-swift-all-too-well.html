Swifties have speculated for years that the song was about Jake, whom Taylor dated for three months in 2010 before she released the song on her album Red.</p><p>At long last, Jake has addressed the matter.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“It has nothing to do with me. It’s about her relationship with her fans,”</a> he said in an interview with Esquire. “It is her expression.

Not about any individual, per se, but a conversation that allows us to examine how we can—or should, even—take responsibility for what we put into the world, our contributions into the world. How do we provoke a conversation? We see that in politics. There’s anger and divisiveness, and it’s literally life-threatening in the extreme.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Taylor Swift And Ed Sheeran's Friendship</a></span></p><p>A scarf mentioned in the lyrics of the song <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has become something of a fabled accessory.</a> Media outlets have claimed it was originally lost at the house of Jake’s sisters, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. <a href=#>Taylor never got her scarf back</a>, and its whereabouts have become a pop culture mystery, with many agreeing that the legendary scarf has become more than a simple piece of outerwear.</p><p>The scarf has become a symbol in Swift's fandom, inspiring jokes, memes, and interview questions.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqOVYrS6uMuepaGZkaF6p7XNmqOlsV2WsaW%2BxKyqnqtdmsVuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZpilpF2pvLB51p6jpWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-baby-name-stormi-reactions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner Baby Name Stormi Twitter Reactions</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cillian-murphy-net-worth-irish-peaky-blinders.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is Irish Actor Cillian Murphy Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
