He was recognized for his work as a reporter and anchor at KTTV Channel 11 in Los Angeles. His son informed KTTV on Friday that Valdez had renal failure, which led to his passing, and that he was at home at the time of his death.</p><p>Various reporters and journalists paid tribute to Valdez on different social media platforms, highlighting their years of collaboration with him. Journalist Araksya Karapetyan shared on Facebook about Valdez’s achievements over the years. According to Araksya, she had the opportunity to work with Valdez at Fox 11. She mentioned:</p><p>“I remember how kind and supportive he was from the start when I joined the team. He was genuinely interested in me, in my story, in who I was, what I represented, and what I had to offer the world. We were always on the move, but if we had a few moments between newscasts, we would meet in the newsroom or the hallway and talk about… life.”</p><p>Araksya further disclosed that Tony Valdez used to inquire about her family life and that hearing his voice made her feel secure and reassured. She described Tony’s approach as old-school, encompassing facts, details, emotion, and depth. She continued:</p><p>“I always regret not going on one of his tours to learn more about Los Angeles.” Tony served as a docent for the Los Angeles Conservancy, leading tours of downtown. “One of these days…” I used to say.</p><p>Tony’s son Steve and three grandchildren survive him. Those who wish to contribute may do so to the LA Conservancy or the 8 Ball Foundation.</p><p></p><h2>Tony Valdez’s Long-Standing Career at KTTV Fox 11</h2><p>Tony Valdez never mentioned his upbringing, although he attended Los Angeles City College and California State University. He served in the United States Army for a period of time. In Los Angeles, he worked as a writer, producer, and reporter for KLTA and KCET before moving on to La Opinion and the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. He began at KTTV in 1980, reporting for the news segment of L.A.’s Most Wanted. He also hosted Midday Sunday, a weekly public affairs show focusing on local and national issues with current top news and newsmakers. From 1991 to 1993, he served as the station’s weekend news anchor.</p><p>Valdez left the news station in 2016, and on his final day, the station organized an on-air tribute and farewell. Tony was also the recipient of Emmy, Golden Mike, and Los Angeles Press Club awards for his broadcasting talents. In 2006, Tony Valdez was involved in a dispute with KFI talk show hosts John and Ken. Valdez spoke about Manifest Destiny and criticized the Mormon Battalion monuments, alleging that it was accountable for the deaths of numerous Mexicans. However, these claims were unfounded.</p><p>John and Ken then encouraged their listeners to email KTTV, claiming that Valdez had violated journalistic neutrality. While it was expected that Valdez would apologize during his appearance on Midday Sunday on May 7, 2006, this did not happen, and the station instead issued an apology during the evening program on May 4, 2006.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmipnqafrLumsIynnLCrXaeysbvRrZyrZaSku7p51ZqjnZ2qYr2iv9KeqmaZp5bGbq3TZquhnV2WtKZ5zp9kcHBf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-gucci-perfumes-women-luxury-scent-floral-fragrance-beauty.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shop the 10 Best Gucci Perfumes for Women of 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-fox-green-bikini-forest-mgk-reacts-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Fox Climbs A Tree In A Green Bikini &amp;amp; MGK Reacts Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
