Doesn't it? Likewise, the separation of one of the highly appreciated couples in Hollywood, <strong>Meghan Markle,</strong> and her now ex-husband, <strong>Trevor Engelson&nbsp;</strong>put many of the couple's fans in a shock.&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple dated each other for nearly a decade before walking down the aisle, that's a long time of togetherness. So, why did the couple have to split? Moreover, what's for the couple after they ended their marital relationship.</p><p>Let's find it. Just hang on a little longer!!</p><h2>Meghan Markle and Trevor Engelson split</h2><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle </a>and Trevor Engelson were in a long-haul affair before they got hitched. They began dating in 2004. The Suits star and Engelson took their relationship slow to get to know each other more.&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p>In the wake of dating for a long time, the pair chose to take their love life to the next level and exchanged rings in 2010.</p><p></p><p>Following their engagement, Meghan and Trevor spent a year together before they tied the marital bond and interchanged their vows. The big day came in September 2011 and the two promised to share their lives as a couple. The wedding function took place at the Jamaica Inn Ocho Rios, Jamaica. They didn't need the wedding to be fabulous, so they just had around 100 visitors. I think they believed in love and really didn’t care for a fancy wedding ceremony.</p><p>The native of Los Angeles Meghan and her husband Trevor lived a happy married life for about 2 years and seemed like their relationship would last longer.</p><h2>Meghan’s boyfriend Prince Harry</h2><p>After the end of a 2year long marriage, Meghan took a break from the dating game and focused on her career. It took a while for her to recover from her divorce after that Meghan was rumored to be dating a celebrity chef Cory Vitiello,&nbsp;but the relationship didn’t last long.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Shortly after her breakup with Cory, she met&nbsp;<a href=#>Prince Harry</a> who happened to be in Toronto for a charity. Meghan was there for her shoot for the famous TV series Suits. Call it coincident or fate the two of them met during that event.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>There were rumors that Harry was head over heels when he first laid eyes on Meghan and she also felt the same way. Prince Harry and Meghan exchanged numbers and is said that Harry kept texting her until she agreed to meet him.</p><p>The two of them went on few dates and it was enough for them to fall for each other. Meghan since then has posted a lot of photos on her Instagram account hinting that Harry and Meghan are in a relationship. In one of her photos, she is seen wearing the same bracelet like the one worn by the Prince.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>On Tuesday, November 8, Kensington Palace issued the first official confirmation statement which affirmed the pair is in a relationship and is very serious about it. The letter was emphatic and stressed the abuse Meghan and her family had to experience from the media after the news of their relationship broke out.</p><p>It is rare for such a statement to be issued which means that Prince Harry is madly in love with Meghan Markle and could be the start of a <a href=#>wonderful relationship</a>. Now, their stop will be the wedding ceremony as the couple already got engaged on November 27, 2017.</p><p>To know more about Harry and Meghan check:&nbsp;<a href=#>famousstardom.com</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGiknp%2BYlrtuucCroqWdXZa7pXnHnqlmoKWor6K6w2arq52mpL9usc2gnKWrn6N6tLHPnqmarJWZeqKy056pZmpdrrKivtJmmKecXZmutbXNoGSpqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./micah-abbey-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Micah Abbey - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-marta-bassino-partner-on-instagram-does-marco-casagranda-ski-too-229287-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Marta Bassino Partner On Instagram- Does Marco Casagranda Ski Too?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-young.html>Alex Young Bio, Age, Net Worth, Facts, Height, Career, Married</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-we-know-about-gangsta-boos-boyfriend-emmett.html>All We Know About Gangsta Boos Boyfriend, Emmett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chuck-berry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Chuck Berry Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faze-jarvis.html>Faze Jarvis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-director-comes-out-swinging-to-take-down-the-trolls.html>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director comes out swinging to take down the trolls</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
